"Aaron Rodgers GB (7)","1","336.07","2.00","3.11","","Rodgers was having a fine season before going down with a broken collar bone. He was the QB5 in points per game, and less than 1 point from being the QB2. When Aaron Rodgers plays 16 games, he finishes as the QB1 or QB2 in fantasy. Since 2008 there is only one instance where he didn’t and he finished as the QB7 that year. He’s expensive in drafts, but he’s a safe a bet as it comes."
"Russell Wilson SEA (7)","2","308.29","3.33","6.03","","It was a rough start of the season for Wilson, as it almost always seems to be. After his bye week he became unstoppable. From Week 7 to the season’s end he was the QB1 with 250 points. The QB2 was Ben Roethlisberger...with 186 points. There is some pause for concern as Seattle has been proclaiming throughout the offseason they want to get back to being a running team, backing up that chatter with using their 1st round pick on a running back. Wilson should still be a solid fantasy QB, especially with his rushing floor, but will the coaching scheme limit his ability to be a top-5 QB?"
"Cam Newton CAR (4)","3","307.35","3.67","7.01","","Cam was the definition of a boom/bust player last year. Sure, he finished the year as the QB2 in fantasy. He also busted 44% of the time. Of the other QBs to finish as top-5 fantasy options the second highest bust rate was Alex Smith at 27%. Cam is seeing change yet again as Norv Turner comes in to run the offense. His unmatched running ability as a quarterback gives him fantasy super powers, but the hits and wear on his body are compiling. Fantasy players will need all the rushing production he can get as he averages 22 passing TDs a year, and that includes his outlier season of 35."
"Deshaun Watson HOU (10)","4","291.15","7.00","5.01","","Watson’s 2017 will go down as legend in the lore of fantasy football. He was straight up bad in his first two NFL appearances. He somehow transformed from terrible to being one of the best QBs in football for 5 weeks before losing the season to an ACL tear. In his 5 game reign of terror, he was on pace for nearly 5000 yards and 58 touchdowns. Those numbers are impossible. A 9.3% touchdown percent is not sustainable or matchable for Watson next year. His situation is very similar to Carson Wentz, an ACL tear and an otherworldly touchdown rate. Watson certainly could be incredible, but his draft price is only including his upside and not considering any of the red flags."
"Kirk Cousins MIN (10)","5","281.97","4.00","8.05","","Cousins was a bit maddening last season. He would give either a great performance or a lose-your-week type of game. To make things for frustrating, he would put up duds against bottom defenses like the Giants and Cowboys, but then put up a top-2 finish against teams like Minnesota and Denver. It’s a brand new situation for Cousins as he now is the face of the Vikings. He’s in arguably the best offensive position of his life with Diggs and Theilen, but the Vike’s aren’t afraid to win with their amazing defense and running game. Efficiency will be the key for Cousins to be a fantasy producer. Luckily he has been one of the most accurate QBs in the NFL since taking a starting job in 2015."
"Drew Brees NO (6)","6","281.75","3.33","6.08","","Brees will be very interesting in drafts this season. He could go down as a major value pick at the QB position. Before last year, his worst fantasy finish since 2008 as QB6. Last year despite his finish as the QB9, he only finished as a top-12 QB four times throughout the season. The final six game were incredibly poor for fantasy players. Brees was still incredible with his opportunity, posting the highest completion percentage of all time, but also saw his passing attempts drop by 150. He excelled in every passing category but touchdown percentage. Brees will certainly become an all or nothing type of draft pick this season."
"Tom Brady NE (11)","7","281.46","2.00","5.07","","Through three weeks of the season, those that went early on Tommy Terrific were already buying their championship rings. It didn’t go so smoothly after the nuclear start. It wasn’t that Brady was bad at all, he was solid for the most part. He finished the season as the QB3, but was QB11 in points per game from Week 4 through the end of the season. Brady will be 41 entering the season. He’s been bucking the age trend, but it’s fair to ask if he can be worth his draft price."
"Matthew Stafford DET (6)","8","281.19","2.33","9.11","","Stafford has turned his career around in the past three seasons. No longer is he a 59% completion type of QB, but now a 65% passer. A lot of credit needs to be given to OC Jim Bob Cooter. Stafford’s other numbers remain pretty steady. He will throw over 4000 yards and throw in the mid 20’s for touchdowns. He’s been a middle tier QB1 every year but once since 2011. If Marvin Jones can duplicate last year’s success and Kenny Golladay can breakout, Stafford may be able to sneak into that revered top-5 QB area."
"Carson Wentz PHI (9)","9","280.75","6.33","8.02","","Wentz saw an unbelievable jump in production from his rookie season. He was on his way to being the league MVP when he tore his ACL diving into the endzone. Aside from the injury recovery concern, Wentz’s touchdown rate from last year is unsustainable. He jumped from a 2.6% (which in fairness was sure to go up) to 7.5%. Players that have thrown TDs at that pace have historically seen that number drop nearly 2 points the following season as the regress to the mean. It’s not that Wentz can’t be great for fantasy again, but his draft price is going to be costly for a player likely to regress in efficiency. While Andy believes Wentz belongs firmly in the top tiers, Jason and Mike are reserving judgement until his health is proven and the season grows closer."
"Andrew Luck IND (9)","10","279.35","9.00","8.04","","Luck has proven to be an elite fantasy QB, again, when healthy. In 2016, his last healthy season, he put up 346/4240/31 in 15 games, ending the year as the QB4. He has been a top-4 fantasy QB three times since 2013. He was able to fully play in Week 1 of preseason so all signs are a go for Andrew Luck headed into the regular season."
"Ben Roethlisberger PIT (7)","11","277.85","5.67","10.09","","2017 was a tale of two halves for Big Ben. Week 1 through Week 8 he was the QB28 in points per game averaging 12.7PPG. The bye week seemingly came at an optimal time for the Steelers offense. From Week 10 through the end of the season, Ben was the no.1 fantasy QB in points per game. It’s worth noting that OC Todd Haley has moved on this season and will that have a negative impact on the Steelers offense as a whole. Ben is still a late-round QB target since we know his ceiling is immense."
"Philip Rivers LAC (8)","12","272.84","2.00","9.12","","Rivers was incredibly solid last year. He was tied with Russell Wilson and Tom Brady for the highest percentage of finishes as a top-12 QB among QBs that played all 16 games. The reemergence of Keenan Allen certainly helped, especially over those final 7 games. Here we are yet again with fantasy players letting Rivers fall in drafts and maintain his late round value. The injury to Hunter Henry certainly hurts and but Rivers has only finished outside of the QB1 range twice in the past 10 years."
"Patrick Mahomes KC (12)","13","267.56","6.00","0.00","","The Chiefs clearly believe Mahomes is the future. Not only did they spend incredibly to move up in the NFL draft, but the team had a ton of success behind Alex Smith playing out of his mind last year and then traded him. Mahomes has massive arm talent and has elite players around him. Those players now include WR Sammy Watkins. However, since 2011 the QB for Andy Reid finishes on average as the QB16, only twice posting a QB1 finish. The opening schedule for Mahomes is also pretty brutal, but he’s worth a dart throw late in drafts."
"Marcus Mariota TEN (8)","14","264.97","4.00","12.04","","Touchdowns. The collapse of Mariota’s 2017 season came down to touchdowns. He was right in the pocket in terms of average attempts, completion percentage, and passing yards. His TD rate plummeted from a very solid 5.8% to an apocalyptic 2.9%. Mariota has a new coaching staff running things in Tennessee. Matt Lafleur is a descendent of the Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay offensive scheme. The ceiling of Mariota’s fantasy finish is a complete unknown, but at the very least a return to fantasy relevance should come with no surprise."
"Matt Ryan ATL (8)","15","263.45","3.67","10.02","","It was clear that regression was coming for Matt Ryan. He posted absurd numbers in 2016 with a touchdown percentage nearly 2.5 points above his career average and a yards-per-attempt number nearly a full 2 yards over his career average. Regression expected yes, but a complete fantasy flop was not. He dropped over 900 yards and saw his passing touchdown total plummet from 38 to 20. The team will be operating it’s 2nd year of Steve Sarkisian’s offense, so there’s a chance of improvement. Ryan will also be available later in drafts, often falling out of the top-12 QBs drafted."
"Alex Smith WAS (4)","16","263.22","3.67","12.08","","Smith is fascinating this year. Despite coming off his best professional and best fantasy season, drafters want nothing to do with him. This isn’t wrong by any stretch, it’s hard to get behind a 34-year old that just surpassed 4000 yards and 25 TDs for the first time in his career. He’s also now the franchise player for Washington. However, it isn’t inconceivable for Smith to put up numbers somewhat similar to what Kirk Cousins managed in Jay Gruden’s offense. Kirk had 3 straight years of over 4000 yards and averaged 26 touchdowns. While it’s far more likely that Smith returns to his middling QB2 fantasy production, keep an eye on him."
"Dak Prescott DAL (8)","17","261.57","5.67","13.12","","What happened here?? WHAT HAPPENED?? Through Week 7 of the NFL season, Dak was the no.1 fantasy QB in points per game. That’s over players like Carson Wentz and the buzzsaw that was Deshaun Watson. Number freaking one. Week 8 til the end of the season? QB34 in points per game. There are a lot places to throw blame in Dallas. The collapse of Dez Bryant, losing elite LT Tyron Smith, losing Zeke to suspension, but the predominant blame must go directly on Dak. So again, what happened? Fantasy players are not forgiving Dak for the 2nd half of the season and it will not be abnormal to see him fall out of the top-15 QBs drafted if drafted at all. It’s going to be tough to dive back in with him, but he’s not the worst late-round QB to target (author quickly runs out of the room)."
"Jimmy Garoppolo SF (11)","18","261.24","4.00","9.01","","The fantasy world is on fire for the Handsome One Jimmy GQ. Fantasy players should be a little wary of paying up for him though. His yardage in his 5 starts was great, throwing a nearly 5000 yard pace, but he was only pacing for 19 TDs in that time. His TD percentage was a suboptimal 3.9% which should see some positive regression. The problem is his draft price is that of a known commodity instead of projecting upside. He’s already being drafted in the top-10 of his position. There are plenty of reasons to like him, but be cautious with his hype train."
"Jared Goff LAR (12)","19","258.13","3.33","11.07","","Goff looked like a bust, smelled like a bust, performed like a bust last year. Low and behold Goff was simply another victim of Jeff Fisher’s ineptitude. New HC Sean McVay brought a fresh offensive scheme that saw the Rams become the number one scoring offense in football. Goff wasn’t a league winning type of fantasy QB, but he had some huge weeks and was a great streaming option. It’s likely he oversucceed with a touchdown rate of 5.9% and a TD to INT ratio of 28:7. With regression coming and his draft price, Goff feels a lot like Derek Carr did last year."
"Case Keenum DEN (10)","20","247.15","3.67","0.00","","Scratching and biting and clawing, Case Keenum finally got a real shot to be a starting QB and he brought his team within a whisper of the Super Bowl. Despite his 12-3 record and a noteworthy 22/7 TD to INT ratio, the Vikings shook their heads and passed on bringing him back, choosing to sign Kirk Cousins. Keenum takes his talents to Denver where he will be in a very similar situation as Minnesota. He will manage games with two high-end WRs and a great defense. Keenum had his stretches for fantasy last year. He was a QB1 46% of the time while providing some week winning games. He’s not an awful late-round target, but time will tell if he’s a one-hit wonder like Chumbawumba."
"Blake Bortles JAC (9)","21","246.49","4.33","0.00","","Say what you will about Blake The Snake, but for QB streamers he was a league winner at the end of the season. From Week 12 through Week 16 (because Week 17 championship games are bad) Blake Bortles was the no.2 overall fantasy QB. His improved defense has removed Bortles as a garbage-time hero and he’s not a player you are going to want to plug-and-play. However, he isn’t as bad as his public perception and will frequently be an excellent streaming option."
"Andy Dalton CIN (9)","22","245.98","5.00","0.00","","The signs of positive regression were there for Andy Dalton this past year, and to be fair his touchdown percent did jump from 3.2% back to 5.0%. The problem became his completions dropping by 50 and a near 1000 yard drop in passing yards. Dalton didn’t play particularly well, but his offensive line was abysmal. The team has made some decent offseason moves to improve in that area. Dalton could be viewed as an ok late round option, but should likely be treated as a waiver wire streaming option."
"Derek Carr OAK (7)","23","241.71","5.33","12.09","","Carr was identified as a bust in last year’s UDK. He followed up his QB10 finish of 2016 coming in as the QB19. From Week 8 to the season’s end Carr was the QB32 in points per game. That’s behind Brock Osweiler. Brock. Osweiler. The team dismissed Carr’s most reliable pass catcher Michael Crabtree and brought in head coach Jon Gruden. Gruden has had a ‘unique’ offseason bringing in more than a handful of ‘seasoned’ veterans. Gruden has also talked up relying on the run game more than the Raiders have been. Carr will now be available late enough that he’s not a risky pick, but the ceiling appears more like an 8-footer and not the vaulted type."
"Ryan Tannehill MIA (11)","24","241.33","6.83","0.00","","It’s been a while since we’ve seen Tannehill play football after losing last year to an ACL injury. In 2016 he was only a QB1 39% of the time. He has finished the season as a QB1 once, but that was in 2014. His running ability has to be at least questioned since the production was already trending down and now he’s coming off a torn ACL. He will be free in drafts, but he’s likely a get what you pay for type of fantasy QB."
"Eli Manning NYG (9)","25","239.82","4.33","14.06","","It was tough in the streets for Eli last year. His team was awful. He had his worst statistical year since 2008. He saw his consecutive game streak end in truly embarrassing fashion when he was benched in favor of Geno Smith. Don’t let last year make you completely fade him for this season. He is surrounded by elite offensive weapons including the return of Odell Beckham and the drafting of Saquon Barkley who is a top level pass catching RB. The Giants had the 2nd overall pick and did not draft a QB, placing their entire support behind Eli being the QB for this year and the foreseeable future. Eli is a solid late round option whose possible outcomes include a return to a top-10 fantasy QB."
"Mitch Trubisky CHI (5)","26","234.46","6.33","0.00","","Let’s get the comp out of the way. People want Trubisky to be this year’s Jared Goff. A lackluster year for a rookie QB who is no longer enveloped in the dark shroud of a terrible outdated coach. Yes Trubisky is now surrounded by talent, including an elite WR in Allen Robinson, and a great offensive mind in Matt Nagy is running the show. Mitch was only allowed to throw the ball more than 20 times in 3 of 12 games so it’s hard to even evaluate his performance. He’s going to be available late, has a sliver of a breakout chance, but seeing a top-12 finish is not an easily focused outcome."
"Jameis Winston TB (5)","27","221.41","8.00","13.12","","Winston was having a pretty solid season before a shoulder injury derailed things in the middle. He tried to play through, but was visibly in pain and his play suffered. He was a yardage monster after recovering, playing at a 5k yard pace over the final five games. The emergence of Chris Godwin and OJ Howard could help set the table for the breakout year we have all waited for for Jameis Winston. The nice thing for players interested in Winston this year, you don’t have to pay the price for a projected breakout. He’s currently going very late in drafts. | Update: Winston is facing a 3 game suspension and should not be drafted in single QB leagues. He may be a great waiver add in the season though."
"Josh Allen BUF (11)","28","215.89","7.67","0.00","","The offseason arguments of Josh Allen are finally put to rest and he’s the future franchise QB of the Buffalo Bills. Allen faces an uphill battle on a team with the best pass catcher on the team being a running back. The team lost three starters on the offensive line. Allen showed tremendous struggles with accuracy at the college level. May fortune shine upon those willing to put any fantasy faith upon Josh Allen."
"Sam Bradford ARI (9)","29","211.40","8.33","0.00","","When it comes to Bradford 2 things are for certain: He’s going to make millions and millions of dollars and he’s not going to play 16 games. Bradford looked incredible in Week 1 last year, but that game and a terrible half against the Bears was all we got to see. The Cardinals apparently saw enough to make him their veteran bridge QB for a few years. Those plans changed when Josh Rosen fell in the NFL Draft and the Cards moved up to get him. Bradford should be the Week 1 starter for Arizona and could honestly have some decent fantasy games. Aside from his health, the overall success of the Cardinals will go a long way in determining how long Bradford is the starting QB."
"Joe Flacco BAL (10)","30","211.32","5.67","0.00","","If you find yourself in a 12-team league that is forced to start 3 quarterbacks, then you might consider drafting Flacco. If that description does not match your league, do not draft Joe Flacco."
"Josh McCown NYJ (11)","31","164.38","8.00","0.00","","It took 15 seasons and playing for 8 teams, but McCown finally had his best season in the NFL, granted that season was only 13 games long. McCown proved to be a viable streamer in the right situations. He’s likely to begin the year as the starter, but will be on a very short leash with the Jets drafting their new franchise QB Sam Darnold with the 3rd overall pick in the draft. No need to put any fantasy stock in McCown at this point."
"Tyrod Taylor CLE (11)","32","158.26","8.00","0.00","","Tyrod was coming off a nice QB8 finish in fantasy in 2016. Unfortunately some external choices had a major negative impact on Taylor. The Bills got rid of a bunch of good players including their no.1 WR Sammy Watkins. The coaching staff refused to place any support behind Taylor, eventually benching him for Nathan Peterman who infamously threw 5 interceptions in 14 attempts. Taylor was traded to the Browns this offseason for a 3rd round pick, which is not cheap. The Browns also added QB Baker Mayfield with first overall pick. Taylor can be a decent fantasy option with his running game and he’s surrounded by the best pass catchers of his career. Hue Jackson has pledged his support for Taylor to start all season, but history warns that Taylor will find the bench sooner than later."
"Sam Darnold NYJ (11)","33","156.20","7.50","0.00","","Darnold fell into the laps of the Jets when the Giants passed on a QB and took running back Saquon Barkley. The offense as a whole isn’t very desirable for fantasy football. Sam will have to take the job from veteran Josh McCown, who to be fair was decent last year. Darnold will be taking snaps at some point this season, but isn’t likely to be fantasy relevant."
"Baker Mayfield CLE (11)","34","117.02","7.50","0.00","","The first overall pick in the 2018 draft may have to wait for his time in the sun. The Browns traded a 3rd rounder for veteran Tyrod Taylor and have at least verbally committed to him for the time being. Baker showed incredible accuracy in all levels of the passing attack. The team has a bunch of pass-catching weapons. He’s worth a watch on the waiver wire, but it’s not known when he will actually get a shot."
"Josh Rosen ARI (9)","35","59.11","6.00","0.00","","Rosen was drafted to be the future of the Arizona Cardinals. He is reportedly impressing already as he takes 1st team reps during the offseason. It will be fascinating to see if Arizona has the intestinal fortitude to pull the plug on their 20 million dollar investment Sam Bradford. There is reason to like whoever starts for AZ with some solid offensive pieces including David Johnson and Larry Fitzgerald. It’s more than likely Bradford will start the season but Rosen will finish it."
"Lamar Jackson BAL (10)","36","38.23","7.00","0.00","","Jackson will try to put heat on veteran Joe Flacco in training camp this year. Flacco will have to faceplant to lose the job, the team was 9-7 last year and contended for a playoff spot. The good news is the fantasy upside for Jackson is tremendous. The rushing floor will be there for one of colleges most prolific running QBs. The WR core has the talent that could complement the playstyle of Jackson buying time while they get open. Jackson will be a hot waiver add if any word breaks of him getting 1st team reps."
