"rb","Rank","Points","Risk","ADP","Vid","Notes"
"Todd Gurley LAR (12)","1","304.20","1.70","1.02","","Finally free from the shackles of Jeff Fisher, a competent offensive-mind took Gurley and unleashed the RB to his full potential. He had only one more carry in 2017 compared to 2016, but gained over 220 additional rushing yards. Gurley went from 58 targets to 87 targets. Gurley has jumped right back into the 1.01 conversation, but this time he’s surrounded by the league's number one scoring offense."
"LeVeon Bell PIT (7)","2","300.20","2.70","1.02","","The Steelers threw a tantrum Week 1 after Lev held out for training camp, and only gave him 10 carries to start the season. Things returned to normal, thankfully, and he ended the season as the fantasy RB2. He was the only RB with over 400 touches and entering 2018 once again on a franchise contract, there’s no reason for Pitt to pull his volume. The only concern for Bell is injury related, he’s safe."
"David Johnson ARI (9)","3","285.20","2.70","1.04","","2017 was a massive disappointment for DJ and all those that spent the 1.01 on him in fantasy drafts. The good news, his missed season due to a pretty flukey wrist injury and he’s already ready to go. The bad news, he’s in a completely new offense and the Cardinals have been depleted of veteran offensive skill players. DJ should remain the focal point of the offense being fed carries and targets, but his chance at hitting 20 total touchdowns like in 2016 seems an ephemeral dream."
"Alvin Kamara NO (6)","4","266.10","2.70","1.06","","Holy crap Super Kamario set the world on fire last year. The only thing that stopped his run of seven straight RB1 games was a concussion. Fantasy players are going to have to pay up to draft him this year and he does have some regression concerns, considering he had one of the most efficient seasons in history. Mark Ingram will be facing a four game suspension to start the season, further allowing Kamara to become the alpha in the backfield. Andy has a great article on his full endorsement of Kamara that is worth a read. His skill in the receiving game makes Kamara an easy 1st round pick."
"Ezekiel Elliott DAL (8)","5","260.00","2.70","1.04","","Elliott was the story of the season with the drama of his suspension coming and going. Eventually the 6-game punishment caught up to him. While it was rough for fantasy players to carry an unusable asset, Zeke put up monstrous numbers when he played. Throwing out the albatross game against Denver, Zeke put up a line of 233/975/7...in 9 games. If Zeke was awarded his average points per game for the suspension, he would’ve finished as RB2."
"Melvin Gordon LAC (8)","6","251.80","3.70","1.09","","Melvin Gordon finally shook the demons of the 1k rushing yard club, but remained inefficient as a sub 4.0YPC runner. That didn’t seem to bother to Chargers coaching staff that handed him the ball 284 times and 83 targets. Gordon is polarizing as an NFL player, but his fantasy stock should come without question. He’s a 3-down running back in a world with very few remaining."
"Saquon Barkley NYG (9)","7","249.70","3.30","1.07","","Barkley completely shatters any and all college production models. He profiled heading into the draft as a 3-down running back that can help an offense in every facet of the game. The Giants coveted him enough to spend the 2nd overall pick on him. He joins an offense that is a powder keg waiting to explode at any time with Odell Beckham, Evan Engram, and Sterling Shepard. Massive talent, massive opportunity, plus a strong offense will make Barkley a safe pick in the 1st round of fantasy drafts."
"Leonard Fournette JAC (9)","8","243.40","4.00","1.10","","People expected a massive year from the 4th overall pick in the 2017 draft by the Jags. The workload was there. Fournette was 1 of 6 RBs with over 300 touches. He finished as the RB8. It wasn’t all glitter and gold for the rookie. He struggled with injuries and some inefficiencies, finishing the year with a 3.88YPC average. That’s not going to deter the Jags from feeding him like he’s at Old Country Buffet. Mix in the Jags defense providing a lot of positive game scripts, and Fournette should finish as an RB1."
"Christian McCaffrey CAR (4)","9","233.00","2.70","2.01","","CMac lead the position in terms of target volume, being showered with 113 targets. He had a ridiculous 22.6% of the teams targets. The team did bring in CJ Anderson to replace the recently released Jonathan Stewart. That shouldn’t stop CMac from seeing an uptick in rushing volume, but it certainly caps out his ability to see the 200 carries people were hoping to see him receive. He finished last year as an RB1 and with the volume he will get, especially in the valuable passing game, CMac will be consistently good but not great."
"Kareem Hunt KC (12)","10","228.00","4.70","1.11","","Hunt took over the starting RB role in Kansas City because of an injury to Spencer Ware. He took that opportunity and completely dominated the league for the first seven weeks of the season. A pretty sizable lull occured for the next five weeks before Hunt was able to turn the turbo jets on for the fantasy playoffs. He’s a bit of a wildcard with the return of Ware. Hunt had the highest percentage of RB attempts for any team at 86%. Even workhorse Todd Gurley was under 80%. Hunt is sure to be the primary ball carrier, but his volume will go down compared to last season."
"Dalvin Cook MIN (10)","11","215.50","5.70","2.03","","Cook was a man on a mission to prove the haters wrong. Through four games he was certainly accomplishing that goal, especially in fantasy finishing as an RB1 in 2 of his 4 games. Unfortunately, an ACL tear cut his rookie season short in that fourth game. Coming off the injury isn’t what it used to be and it happened early enough in the season that Cook should be ready to go for preseason. The workload he was getting last year should remain intact, but Latavius wasn’t fully healthy when Cook was playing, so that risk must be assessed when drafting him early."
"Jerick McKinnon SF (11)","12","211.00","4.60","3.04","","McKinnon has always felt like a fantasy rocket that failed to reach orbit every single year. 2017 was his best year, but his future looked murky as entered free agency. Then he hit the fantasy lottery when he was handed a massive contract and a starting role for Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers. McKinnon should be locked in as the 49ers version of Devonta Freeman, receiving a ton of carries and receptions (Freeman averaged 64 receptions a year under KShy). The questions of can McKinnon really produce are legit, his ADP is going to balloon, but the potential is very real."
"Devonta Freeman ATL (8)","13","210.60","4.30","2.07","","Freeman dropped out of the RB1 club for the first time since his fantasy breakout. To be fair, he did miss two games and finished as the RB13. He still remains on a higher powered offense, but the drop in his target-share was concerning. Under new OC Steve Sarkisian, Freeman saw his targets drop from 65 to 47 and also saw his red-zone carries drop from 27 to 19. He’s still a solid fantasy player, but a top-5 finish doesn’t seem likely."
"LeSean McCoy BUF (11)","14","209.50","6.70","3.05","","It was a down year in terms of production for McCoy. He still finished as the RB7, but he set career-low marks in yards per carry and yards after catch. Coach McDermott moved the Bills away from running out of the shotgun formation, where Shady has been sensational in his career. The Bills have a depleted roster and now have their hopes attached to polarizing rookie Josh Allen. Thankfully, volume is king in the land of fantasy and McCoy is set up for another heavy workload."
"Joe Mixon CIN (9)","15","193.60","4.50","2.11","","It was not a great start for Mixon. By Week 3 he was getting the volume of a starter, but could not overcome Cincinnati's poor offensive line and poor offense in general. He managed to put up some decent fantasy weeks, but a concussion derailed his momentum once he was really getting started. Mixon will be drafted as a higher end RB, there’s enough there to believe he can become a fantasy stud, but he still carries risk and Gio Bernard is still around to limit his target share."
"Jordan Howard CHI (5)","16","192.70","4.20","2.08","","Howard proved his rookie season was no fluke after carrying the ball 276 for 1120 yards. He even managed to drop 9 TDs despite being hamstrung by an offense straight out of the dark ages. The Bears have now gone all in on the offense and sophomore QB Mitch Trubisky. Even though Howard could lose more work to Tarik Cohen, the offensive possibilities of the Bears give Howard a very appealing ceiling."
"Alex Collins BAL (10)","17","173.80","5.30","3.10","","Once Collins took a full grasp of the starting RB job for the Ravens he was a stud. He was the RB9 in points per game through the end of the season. The Ravens brought him back on a 1-year exclusive rights free agent contract. It’s certainly not as secure as a multi-year deal, but the team’s depth chart is not strong by any means. The team appears poised to ride this season on the back of Collins."
"Royce Freeman DEN (10)","18","173.30","6.00","3.08","","The Broncos grabbed Oregon’s former RB and the NCAA’s 7th most productive player of all time in the 3rd round. Freeman does not ‘WOW’ with any particular part of his game, but he can do everything. The team has thrown support behind incumbent Devontae Booker throughout the offseason, but the pick of Freeman speaks against that. Freeman will have to earn the job, but he has the ability to. If he grabs the starting job before the season, he should easily finish as a RB2."
"Jay Ajayi PHI (9)","19","161.70","4.30","4.10","","It was a busted fantasy year for the superstar of the Miami news cycle. A first round pick in ADP, not only was Ajayi traded to Philly midseason, but he finished as the RB36. He didn’t receive a healthy workload from the Eagles until the NFL playoffs. There is a path to higher volume for Jay with LeGarrette Blount leaving for the Lions, but Doug Pederson and Co. have shown the desire to run with a large committee in the backfield. Ajayi is the quintessential boom/bust pick."
"Dion Lewis TEN (8)","20","160.00","5.70","5.07","","A 16-Game Dion Lewis is pretty freaking good. He had to fend off Mike Gillislee and Rex Burkhead to finally become the man in New England, but once he did he was a monster. From Week 6 on, Lewis as the RB8 in points per game. He’s got a new gig now and the Quickness to Derrick Henry’s Thickness in Tennessee. Lewis can be deadly in the passing game, but it’s questionable how many attempts he will get with Henry as the big cheese. Lewis may be the better value in drafts, the ADP of the Tenn backs is something to watch this summer."
"Kenyan Drake MIA (11)","21","159.20","5.50","4.03","","Drake will be a very polarizing player this year. The first six games of the season Drake got 4 carries. 4. The first four games after the Jay Ajayi trade, Drake was in a full timeshare situation with the inferior Damien Williams. It wasn’t until Drake was all alone until that he exploded as a fantasy stud. Miami’s actions this offseason of adding Frank Gore and Kalen Ballage should cause at least a pause before drafting Drake. The talent and potential are there, but is the opportunity?"
"Marshawn Lynch OAK (7)","22","156.70","5.70","5.06","","It was a strange year for Marshawn after he came out of retirement. He was fairly productive when he was given opportunity, but there was several games where the Raiders didn’t even get him to 10 touches. There is a new head honcho in town named Jon Gruden. Gruden has alluded to the fact he wants to get back to ‘old school’ football, and that talk was backed up by bringing in more RB depth with Doug Martin. Lynch should shape up as a fine RB2, but he’s in a rough division and could find himself getting game-scripted out more than fantasy players hope."
"Lamar Miller HOU (10)","23","156.00","6.30","4.05","","Lamar is a confusing player entering this fantasy season. He’s coming off his most inefficient year as a pro. He was entering a timeshare with D’Onta Foreman. Then he took a backseat to Alfred Blue for the final 3 games of the season. Houston didn’t make any RB noise in the draft or in free agency. Foreman could find himself on the PUP (missing 6 games) to start the year as he recovers from his achilles injury. Miller may de facto himself back into a full workload. He was a much better player when Deshaun Watson was running the Houston offense and could be a value pick in fantasy drafts."
"Rex Burkhead NE (11)","24","154.50","5.30","6.01","","When Burkhead was active last year, he was a pretty consistent option for your fantasy squad. He finished as a top-20 RB in 6 of 10 games last year. He was set up for a big gain in opportunity, but the Pats used a 1st round pick on RB Sony Michel. Burkhead will still see the field, but you will have to accept the dud games with the stud games."
"Tevin Coleman ATL (8)","25","152.30","4.50","7.03","","Coleman saw his backup duty to Devonta Freeman continue in 2017, but we got a glimpse of what he can do as a starter as well. In the two games that Freeman missed, and the one he left with injury, Coleman averaged 20 carries a game. He manhandled Dallas and Tampa, but was inefficient against Seattle. It’s hard to see Coleman getting more than his regular 8 carries a game, but he is a big play specialist on the ground and through the air. He’s a very high value handcuff, but the #ColemanTruthers are still a year away from seeing his true potential."
"Derrick Henry TEN (8)","26","151.90","4.70","4.03","","Finally, King Henry had the opportunity to be unleashed as a dominant fantasy force!  And that’s when the Titans gave Dion Lewis a sizeable free agent contract. Henry should still be in line for the bulk of the early down work, but his potential 3-down role has been incinerated. Throw in the possibility that Lewis is simply a better RB and becomes the starter, and Henry may be a risky early pick."
"Mark Ingram NO (6)","27","145.50","7.80","5.01","","Ingram had a great 2017. He had the 10th most touches at the RB position, had over 1100 rushing yards, and finished as the RB6. Then he went and got himself a 4 game suspension heading into 2018. The Saints also have their bye during Week 6. Meaning for 38% of the fantasy season, Ingram can play once. He could fall far enough in the draft that he’s worth the grab and stash, but his return to dominance is not guaranteed. Alvin Kamara took over as the primary runner towards the end of last year. Ingram is in a contract year, and there are whispers of butting heads between him and the team. The pot of gold at the end of this rainbow is shiny, but it’s an arduous journey to get there."
"Sony Michel NE (11)","28","143.40","5.70","8.04","","The Patriots shocked the draft community when they took Michel at the back of the 1st round. Michel was incredibly impressive at Georgia and showed a talent for the receiving game (which that Pats utilize more than nearly all teams in the NFL). He is instantly the most talented RB on the team but in college had a terrible fumbling problem. Coach Belichick has no patience for RB fumbles. Assuming Michel takes care of the ball he will be in line for massive volume. If he can earn goal line carries, he will be a dominant fantasy RB. | UPDATE: Sony Michel has been sidelined with a knee injury. The time table for his return has been all over the map from 10 days to the entirety of preseason. Fantasy owners must be aware that Michel does have a history of multiple knee injuries dating back to college and an ACL tear dating back to high school. In the short term, he is week to week."
"Isaiah Crowell NYJ (11)","29","141.70","5.70","8.01","","Through the 2017 offseason, Crowell looked like he could be a draft day deal. Then the hype train carried him into the 2nd/3rd round. Unfortunately, regression kicked in and despite carrying the ball 6 more times in 2018, Crowell saw his 2017 rushing total fall by 100 yards and his TD total drop by 5. The Crow moves to the New York Jets to take over for the newly retired Matt Forte. It appears to be a minor improvement in offensive situation for him. He will have passing game competition again, this time from Bilal Powell. He’s likely to be a TD dependant option for fantasy."
"Kerryon Johnson DET (6)","30","141.10","6.30","5.10","","Pay attention when a team trades up in the NFL Draft to get their guy. That’s exactly what the Lions did in the 2nd round with Kerryon Johnson. It is a murky backfield with the team adding Legarrette Blount and reception specialist Theo Riddick still on the team. It will likely be a slow start, but Johnson has the skill set to be a 3-down player. Players should not ignore the fact that Detroit is and has been one of the pass-happy teams of the league and it’s been a long time since an RB has succeeded there."
"Rashaad Penny SEA (7)","31","134.70","4.70","7.09","","If any rookie can challenge Barkley to finish on top, it’s Rashaad Penny. Follow the money and you’ll see a team that desires to be run-heavy and spent their 1st round pick on an RB. Penny was a mega producer in college and showed capable in the receiving game. Coach Pete Carroll is already talking about Penny as a 3-down back. His opportunity and talent make him a very intriguing fantasy pick. | UPDATE: Penny has suffered a broken finger during training camp. It's likely he will miss the start of the season."
"Tarik Cohen CHI (5)","32","133.30","3.70","7.02","","Cohen was a PPR monster to open the season. Over the first four games of the season he pulled in 24 receptions and was averaging over 80 yards a game. Those first four games also had Mike Glennon under center. The final twelve games of the season with rookie Mitch Trubisky running the show, Cohen had 29 receptions. Granted, 24 of those came in the final 6 games. There is hope for Cohen to continue his breakout with new offensive-minded coach Matt Nagy. Cohen received plenty of praise from the new coaching staff immediately and he’s going to available late in drafts."
"Carlos Hyde CLE (11)","33","129.60","5.70","5.08","","Hyde turned his solid 2017 campaign into a new contract...with the Cleveland Browns. Things descended further when the team spent a 2nd round pick on rookie RB Nick Chubb. Hyde has the talent to make a fantasy impact this season, but he now plays for a bad team, in a crowded backfield, and still has his injury concerns."
"Jamaal Williams GB (7)","34","128.90","6.70","7.06","","Opportunity is king in fantasy football and Williams lived that expression to the fullest. Well, fullest in terms of fantasy football not in terms of being a good RB. Williams was the primary RB for the Packers for the final eight games of the season. He had a rushing line of 142/522, that’s 3.68YPC. He did turn 30 targets into 21/224 in the receiving game. That made him a top-24 fantasy RB in 5 of 8 games. | UPDATE: Aaron Jones has been suspended for the first 2 games. It could be a split workload between Ty Montygomery and Jamaal Williams to open the season. Jamaal Williams is the projected starter but Ty Montgomery could still steal some 3rd down/passing work."
"Bilal Powell NYJ (11)","35","126.00","5.30","11.12","","The career of Bilal is a strange one in New York. When he is given opportunity, he almost always comes through with a big performance. And yet, the Jets don’t want to let it ride and see what Powell can really do. Matt Forte left a roster hole after he retired, but the team picked up Isaiah Crowell to be the team’s grinder. Powell has some late-round juice, but without an injury in front of him, his useage is hard to predict."
"Marlon Mack IND (9)","36","125.70","5.80","8.12","","Mack underwent shoulder surgery in early May to repair a torn labrum that he played the season with. Despite breaking a few huge plays, Mack was wildly inefficient and could not pass the ageless wonder Frank Gore on the depth chart. With Gore now playing football in Miami, Mack could be setup for a large workload. The Colts did draft scatback Nyheim Hines and grinder Jordan Wilkins to go along with Robert Turbin and Christine Michael. Basically the Colts backfield is a mess but someone will have value and Mack has the clearest path to opportunity. | UPDATE: Mack suffered a strained hamstring during the team’s first preseason game and could he held out for the rest of preseason. The Colts are hoping to have him available for Week 1."
"Peyton Barber TB (5)","37","125.60","4.00","7.08","","Peyton Barber could very well be a worthless RB prospect this season, but he shouldn't be forgotten. When Doug Martin failed last year, Peyton Barber came in and played far better. Yes, the Bucs just drafted rookie Ronald Jones but that doesn't guarantee that he will be benched. If he gets an opportunity he could return good value super late in drafts."
"Duke Johnson CLE (11)","38","121.80","4.30","8.06","","Duke was yet again left to the later rounds of fantasy drafts and yet again was a valuable fantasy player. He finished as the RB15 off the power of 74 receptions. The addition of Nick Chubb to the Browns backfield has muddied things for Carlos Hyde. Duke Johnson could end up being lumped in with those two, but his role as the pass catching RB is secure. Look for Duke to provide a RB value yet again."
"Chris Thompson WAS (4)","39","119.50","6.70","6.12","","This was finally the year that Thompson broke out. He finished 6 of his first 7 games as a top-20 fantasy RB, including 3 top-10 finishes. Unfortunately, he burned too bright and missed the final 6 games of the season to injury as he often does. He will still be in line for passing downs work for Washington, but most likely Rob Kelley and Samaje Perine will be handling the bulk of the ground game. Thompson also saw his previous yards per reception average skyrocket from 7YPR the previous two years, to over 13YPR. Regression is coming."
"Ty Montgomery GB (7)","40","119.10","7.00","10.09","","Those that took the risk and drafted Ty Monty early last year were riding a high that few fantasy players have ever felt. It was short lived, as he was quickly injured and saw Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams take over his job. It’s possible the Packers give him another shot to be the starting RB, but that’s far from a sure thing. If Jupiter aligns with Mars and he becomes the man again, he will have major upside. But for now, it’s as they say, it’s all downhill from here. | UPDATE: Aaron Jones has been suspended for 2 games. It could be a split workload between Ty Monty and Jamaal Williams to open the season."
"Latavius Murray MIN (10)","41","114.00","4.70","11.04","","It was a slow climb to opportunity for Murray. Despite signing a decent free agent contract, Minnesota gave him competition right away by drafting Dalvin Cook in the 2nd round. While Murray healed from off-season surgery, he saw the rookie take a commanding hold on the starting RB job for the Vikings. Cook suffered an ACL tear in Week 4 and opened the doors for Murray. He ended the year with 216 carries, pretty solid opportunity considering he didn’t get double digit carries until Week 5. Cook will surely take his starting role back, but Murray is a dark horse to take more work than most fantasy players are expecting."
"Javorius Allen BAL (10)","42","112.50","6.00","0.00","","Javorius ""Buck"" Allen has been a shockingly servicable player in fantasy football over the past few seasons. No matter how much it seems that the Ravens don't care about Allen, he finds a way on the field. Last season he was involved heavily in two valuable situations: pass catching and red zone. In 2018, Buck Allen might be one of the sneaker late adds to your roster that can help out in your flex position."
"Devontae Booker DEN (10)","43","111.60","5.30","13.10","","Offseason reports had the Broncos very high on Booker and wanting him to be the lead back. When the team released CJ Anderson it seemed like that chatter was to become a reality. But then the team drafted the well-rounded Royce Freeman in the 3rd round. Booker should be given the veteran opportunity to take the job, but his past performances can’t inspire hope of him holding off the rookie. Booker could be a late value in the draft for a few games early in the season."
"Giovani Bernard CIN (9)","44","111.00","4.30","11.08","","Gio was averaging 3 carries and 2 receptions per game from Week 1 - Week 11. When start Joe Mixon missed a few games from injury, Gio did become the starter and excelled in the role. But it’s clear the Bengals backfield will go through Joe Mixon and with the drafting of Gio clone Mark Walton, Bernard could see his time in Cinci coming to an end."
"Ronald Jones II TB (5)","45","110.60","4.70","8.06","","Jones is the perfect YouTube player. His highlight film is sensational and makes him look like one of the best prospects of all time. Unfortunately his game has some serious concerns. He was drafted in the 2nd round by a very RB-needy team in the Buccaneers, so the opportunity should be there immediately. Charles Sims was brought back to be the primary 3rd down player and Peyton Barber was the best RB on the team last year. It can’t be ignored that Jones oozes upside from his home run ability."
"CJ Anderson CAR (4)","46","109.60","5.00","10.04","","Only 9 RBs had over 1000 rushing yards last season, including CJ Anderson. That production wasn’t good enough for the Broncos and they released him. The Carolina Panthers quickly scooped him up after releasing Jonathan Stewart earlier in the offseason. Anderson should be in line for a decent workload, but the split between him and Christian McCaffrey will be a tough one to project. It's worth noting that he received zero snaps with the 1st team during Week 1 of preseason action."
"Corey Clement PHI (9)","47","108.80","4.00","11.03","","Clement is a great late round flyer. After going undrafted in last year's NFL Draft the Eagles not only signed him, but worked him in more and more as the season went along. People see Clement as a third down option for some reason, but he is 220lbs and was the most often used back inside the 10 yard line as the season went on. With Blount now in Detroit, there is a clear path for Clement to be the primary goal line back for a great offense."
"Frank Gore MIA (11)","48","107.20","5.00","0.00","","The Infinity Stone lives to see another season! Gore is taking his skills and dad bod to south beach and joining the Dolphins. The years in Indy haven’t been the best for Gore, all 3 years he finished under 4.0 YPC, the only 3 seasons of his career to do so. But, he got a ton of volume, over 260 carries every year. He will have to fight off late season sensation Kenyan Drake, but Gore should be in line for another 200 carry season."
"James White NE (11)","49","106.90","3.00","9.02","","White did have 72 targets last season, the 9th most at the position, but was only able to corral that into an RB41 finish. He was useable early on in the season, providing 4 games of RB2 production, but as Rex Burkhead healed up White saw his work diminish. He faces competition for RB targets not only from Burkhead this season, but also from 1st round pick Sony Michel. He’s still worth a look in PPR leagues."
"Matt Breida SF (11)","50","104.10","3.70","12.10","","Matt Breida was decently involved last season behind Carlos Hyde and has looked great in camp. The 49ers brought in a high priced free agent RB, Jerick McKinnon, but should an injury hamper the undersided McKinnon, Breida could be a valuable pickup if he can hold off Joe Williams. | UPDATE: Matt Breida suffered a shoulder injury during the first week of preseason. The MRI showed no structual damage but he's not expected back until Week 1."
"Theo Riddick DET (6)","51","100.00","3.70","13.08","","Riddick will always be a decent option in PPR leagues, but those hoping for a return to the 2015 target share were disappointed. He should be right around the 70 target area, but the addition of Kerryon Johnson in the draft could cut into that. Johnson is not in the same realm as Riddick in the receiving game, but Johnson is very capable and a well rounded back that could eat into Riddick’s snap share."
"Chris Carson SEA (7)","52","99.60","3.70","6.05","","The 2nd to last pick of the 2017 draft was the lone bright spot of the Seahawks backfield in 2016. He burned bright and fast before an injury knocked him out for the season. Carson looked like a decent fantasy pick for this season, until Seattle used their 1st round pick on RB Rashaad Penny. Early projections had Penny getting every opportunity to be a 3-down back with Carson being relegated to handcuff/waiver status. However, training camp and the first week of preseason favor Chris Carson getting a heavier workload. | UPDATE: Rookie Rashaad Penny suffered a broken finger during training camp and is unlikely to be ready for Week 1. Carson should be the Week 1 starter."
"LeGarrette Blount DET (6)","53","97.40","4.70","13.06","","Teams seem overly excited to get rid of Blount despite him having been a serviceable running back. He’s certainly not perfect, but he gets the job done. After an odd start to the year for Philly, including a game with zero touches, Blount had 12+ carries in 8 of the following 9 games, with a near 5.0YPC average. The Eagles began to slowly move towards their new acquisition Jay Ajayi down the stretch. Blount found a new home in Detroit this offseason. The unfortunate news, besides the Lions having been a bottom dweller for running backs in recent history, is the Lions traded up in the 2nd round for Blount’s replacement Kerryon Johnson. Blount could have some early season appeal, but looks to once again be at the back of a timeshare."
"TJ Yeldon JAC (9)","54","95.70","3.70","0.00","","Yeldon’s fantasy stock came crashing down when the Jags spent the 4th overall pick on RB Leonard Fournette. Yeldon wasn’t even active for a game until Fournette suffered an injury in Week 6. He is a competent backup in the event Fournette misses time, which isn’t a bad bet with his ankle and leg injuries, but Yeldon can be avoided in drafts."
"Doug Martin OAK (7)","55","93.80","6.70","14.08","","Merry Krampus everyone! Martin continued his run of destroying fantasy rosters and left lumps of coal for those that drafted him and endured his suspension. The Bucs released him but he found work quickly with Jon Gruden and the Oakland Raiders. Martin will be the backup to Marshawn Lynch and is really only a fantasy option for those that want to short the Lynch stock."
"Nick Chubb CLE (11)","56","91.10","6.00","10.12","","If it weren’t for Saquon Barkley at the Combine, people would have been drooling over the performance of Nick Chubb. Unfortunately for fantasy, he was drafted by the Cleveland Browns. Not that a Browns RB can’t be fantasy relevant, but the team already has Duke Johnson as the passing downs guy, and the grabbed banger Carlos Hyde in free agency. Chubb has the talent to win the starting role, but it’s also in the realm of possibilities he is at the back of a 3-man timeshare."
"Adrian Peterson WAS (4)","57","88.10","8.20","9.09","","Peterson has been signed by the Washington Redskins to add depth to a RB core getting hit right and left with injuries. The future hall-of-famer didn't seem to have much left in the tank, but he performed very well in Week 3 of preseason and should open the season as the starter for the Redskins."
"Nyheim Hines IND (9)","58","88.00","6.00","14.01","","While Hines is slotted as an RB, he’s not the prototypical running back. At 5’8” and under 200lbs he projects as a satellite back. He is very shifty and very fast. His success will rely completely on the team being able to maximize his talents. The Colts selected him in the 4th, but their backfield is wide open. Hopefully Indianapolis watches film of what Tarik Cohen can do when he’s involved in the passing game."
"Spencer Ware KC (12)","59","86.70","6.00","14.07","","Ware suffered a very unfortunate knee injury during the preseason of 2017. He tore his PCL as well as damaged his LCL. In his place, Kareem Hunt was a rookie sensation and made the most of his opportunity. Ware should be healthy and slide back into an offensive role for the Chiefs, but he’s far more likely to be a thorn in buttocks of Kareem Hunt owners than provide his own fantasy value. He will be one of the higher value handcuffs in the league though."
"Aaron Jones GB (7)","60","83.90","6.70","9.03","","Jones received a depth chart miracle when runners TY Montgomery and Jamaal Williams both suffered injuries. He was electric in the following three starts, carrying the ball 49 times for nearly 300 yards. He suffered his own injury and was never unable to overtake Jamaal Williams the remainder of the season. The GB backfield is a mess for fantasy, but wise fantasy players recognize that someone will emerge valuable. Jones was the best runner on the team last year, but it was a very small sample. | UPDATE: Aaron Jones has been suspended for 2 games"
"Darren Sproles PHI (9)","61","83.40","6.30","0.00","","The Scat-Man is back! He was only able to appear in 3 games last season before tearing his ACL. Sproles continued to voice he wanted to play again, and the Eagles obliged by bringing him back. It’s hard to project his role with confidence due to the mini breakout of Corey Clement last season, but a healthy Sproles is a dynamic weapon. He could be worth a flier, but his volume is likely to be enigmatic."
"Chris Ivory BUF (11)","62","79.50","4.70","0.00","","Ivory will be the backup to LeSean McCoy and the Buffalo Bills this season. Last year’s backup Mike Tolbert averaged 6 attempts per game last year. Ivory is a better running back than Tolbert, but his volume doesn’t project to be much higher than what Tolbert was getting last season. He’s a handcuff."
"Jordan Wilkins IND (9)","63","75.80","6.70","12.03","","Jordan Wilkins is one of two rookie running backs drafted by the Colts in 2018. Due to the unknown nature of this backfield, Wilkins gets mentioned as a possible sleeper from time to time, but as of now it appears he is at least third on the depth chart."
"D'onta Foreman HOU (10)","64","70.90","7.30","0.00","","Foreman seemed like he putting a full on breakout performance game when he faced the Cardinals. He ripped off an impressive 34-yard TD run that resulted in him tearing his achilles. An achilles tear is not an easy injury to return from, especially as a running back. Rumors are everywhere from Foreman will be ready for preseason to Foreman will start the year on the PUP list (missing at least 6 weeks). The Texans made no real additions to the backfield, so their actions speak confidence for Foreman to return and be the man."
"Austin Ekeler LAC (8)","65","69.80","4.70","14.05","","Austin Ekeler is a pass catching backup to Melvin Gordon. He's shown the potential to be a very good pass catching back. Rookie Justin Jackson has been hurt throughout most of training camp and early preseason. Ekeler seems to have a firm grasp on the number 2 role behind Gordon."
"Rob Kelley WAS (4)","66","68.90","5.30","13.12","","Rob Kelley has been an average running back who has never really impressed anyone. He could compete with new Redskins RB, Adrian Peterson, for the starting role behind a healthy offensive line in Washington after the ACL injury to rookie Derrius Guice. Peterson played very well in Week 3 of preseason and seems to have the edge to open the season as the starter."
"Kenneth Dixon BAL (10)","67","67.90","7.00","0.00","","The 2017 season was rough for Dixon. First he was suspended for four games for violating the league’s PED policy. He followed that up with a surgery to repair a torn meniscus. It was expected to be a light procedure, but turned into a full repair causing him to miss the season. THEN he was hit with an additional two game suspension for violating the league’s substance abuse policy. The silver lining here is Dixon served the suspension while rehabbing last year. The Ravens brought Alex Collins back but did not spend any draft equity on RB depth. Dixon flashed a few years ago, has opportunity, but it’s a long climb. | UPDATE: Dixon has been dealing with a strained hamstring in training camp. Some beat reporters even consider him to be on the roster bubble."
"CJ Prosise SEA (7)","68","65.90","6.70","0.00","","Remember Week 10 of 2016 when Prosis ripped of the huge run against the Eagles and it looked like the breakout was on? Those were simpler times indeed. Prosis continues to be a giant bag of potential that actually contains sawdust. The Seahawks spent a 1st round pick on Rashaad Penny. Perhaps Prosise gets some passing downs work, but time is running out."
"Kalen Ballage MIA (11)","69","63.30","5.30","0.00","","Ballage is a little enigmatic in the fact that he looks like a bruiser, but he succeeds as a pass catcher. His lateral speed leaves a lot to be desired, but Miami saw enough to grab him in the 4th round when they already had Kenyan Drake and Frank Gore. Miami hasn’t exactly rallied around Kenyan Drake, which could leave the door open for Ballage to earn his way onto the field."
"Elijah McGuire NYJ (11)","70","58.60","4.70","0.00","","Elijah McGuire has been getting buzz from Jets beat writers this offseason including quotes from the running backs coach that compared his skilset to that of hall-of-famer, Ladainian Tomlinson. While that's all good (and absurd) news, for him to have any real fantasy value he needs to completely subplant Bilal Powell or have Powell get cut."
"John Kelly LAR (12)","71","58.30","2.50","0.00","","He was becoming one of Draft Twitter’s favorite sleepers...and then the NFL slept on him and he fell to the Rams in the 6th round. He’s supplanted behind Todd Gurley. It is possible that Kelly’s incredible receiving game gets him on the field, but he’s off the fantasy radar."
"Jalen Richard OAK (7)","72","58.10","4.30","0.00","","Richard will enter 2018 behind Marshawn Lynch and Doug Martin. Although he has flashed a few times, especially in the receiving game, it’s going to hard for Richard to get on the field."
"Corey Grant JAC (9)","73","57.20","3.70","0.00","","Grant has always been an incredibly explosive player. The problem is he simply doesn’t get opportunity. The Jaguars did give him a 2nd round-tender to prevent other teams from poaching him. With Fournette and Yeldon in front of him on the depth chart, it’s not likely he sees a higher snap percentage than last year. If somehow he were to be involved in the game plan, he could become fantasy relevant."
"Jonathan Stewart NYG (9)","74","54.20","4.00","0.00","","It was not an efficient year by any means, but JStew showed he can still handle a heavy workload. The Giants agreed with that sentiment and grabbed him from free agency when Carolina cut him. Unfortunately, the Giants the preceded to use the 2nd overall pick on running back Saquon Barkley. JStew carries close to no fantasy value."
"Wayne Gallman NYG (9)","75","53.80","5.00","0.00","","Gallman actually had some success for the Giants late in the season. The team responded to that success by drafting a running back with the 2nd pick in the NFL Draft. Gallman’s fantasy value is DOA."
"Chase Edmonds ARI (9)","76","53.30","3.70","0.00","","Edmonds is an excellent running back. BUT, he’s behind David Johnson on the Cardinals depth chart. He’s unlikely to see any kind of meaningful touches unless DJ misses time. Edmonds is a high value handcuff with his well-rounded skills."
"Justin Jackson LAC (8)","77","45.20","6.50","0.00","","It’s going to be an uphill battle for Jackson, but he poses at least a threat to Austin Eckler as the Chargers backup running back. It’s a camp battle to watch."
"Samaje Perine WAS (4)","78","43.70","6.00","0.00","","Perine had a massive opportunity last year when starter Robert Kelley went down. Perine does not seem to listen to Eminem because he did not lose himself in the moment, or realize he may have just one chance to blow | Perine will now have another chance as rookie Derrius Guice tore his ACL. However, the Redskins have signed veteran Adrian Peterson. Perine will likely struggle to see much playing time behind Peterson and Rob Kelley."
"Robert Turbin IND (9)","79","34.70","6.30","0.00","","Bicep Bob still has a job with the Colts in spite of owning a 3.1YPC average since joining the team. The Colts seemed enamored with Turbin throughout last offseason, but he was atrocious before ending up on the IR. He will compete to be the early-down back, which does carry fantasy value."
"Jonathan Williams NO (6)","80","29.70","6.50","0.00","","Williams has had a roller coaster beginning of a career. A few years ago he was a hot dynasty commodity, then he was quickly out of the NFL. Well he’s back and he might just have a great opportunity to fill in for Mark Ingram in a starting role for the Saints. Keep an eye on him through the preseason as a sneaky sleeper candidate to start the year."
"Ameer Abdullah DET (6)","81","28.40","7.00","0.00","","Reports out of Detroit have Abdullah upset with his role and lack of touches last year. WELP! The Lions rewarded Abdullah’s performance by bringing in free agent Legarrette Blount, and moving up in the 2nd round to draft Kerryon Johnson. With Theo Riddick locked in as the pass catcher, it’s difficult to see any role for the derailed Abdullah Express."
"Bo Scarbrough DAL (8)","82","26.70","3.80","0.00","","First off, Bo needs to make the Dallas roster. As a 7th round pick, that’s not a lock by any means. If he does make the squad, he will be a high value handcuff behind Ezekiel Elliott. Alfred Morris was plenty productive when he was forced to fill in last year. The Cowboys line makes anyone running behind it and intriguing fantasy option."
"Cameron Artis-Payne CAR (4)","83","8.90","3.00","0.00","","CAP looked like he could turn into the thumper for the Panthers after the team cut Jonathan Stewart, but then they signed CJ Anderson. CAP has no fantasy value with a healthy Anderson on the team."
"James Conner PIT (7)","84","6.00","7.00","14.02","","He’s probably still the backup to Bell, but the Steelers did select Jaylen Samuels in the 5th round. Conner is a handcuff at best, or a waiver landmine at worst."
