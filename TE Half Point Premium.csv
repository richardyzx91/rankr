"te","Rank","Points","Risk","ADP","Vid","Notes"
"Rob Gronkowski NE (11)","1","205.80","5.00","2.10","","The only thing that can stop Gronk is injury. For 3 of the past 4 years, he has been the overall TE1. All signs point to him playing this season, despite the offseason concerns. As of right now, Gronk is going at the top of the 3rd round. That price is palatable for the TE difference maker. No other TE can combine consistency and the weekly ceiling that is Gronk."
"Zach Ertz PHI (9)","2","174.91","1.67","4.06","","Ertz was an absolute breakout stud in 2017. His jump wasn’t particularly shocking for those who had been watching his evolution. However, his red zone efficiency is something to monitor. Ertz posted nearly identical stats in 2016 and 2017, except for his TD increase. In ‘16 he turned 14 red zone targets into 3 TDs. In ‘17 he turned 18 red zone targets into 8 TDs. His QB Wentz is due for some TD regression, but Ertz will still be great for fantasy."
"Travis Kelce KC (12)","3","171.94","2.00","3.07","","Kelce has been extremely solid the past 4 years coming in as a top-8 option in all including a number one and number two finish. However, a big change is coming for Kelce this season at the quarterback position. He should remain a top target in the Chiefs passing attack, logging 3 straight seasons off 100+ targets. He is a safe, albeit, expensive TE option."
"Greg Olsen CAR (4)","4","151.96","5.50","5.12","","Olsen saw his consecutive 1000 yard season streak of 3 come to an end, and saw his full season appearance streak stopped at 9. The Panthers went right back to him with major target volume when he came back from the foot injury, so usage should carry no concern. He remains a top fantasy TE heading into 2018 in spite of the addition of WR DJ Moore in the 1st round of the NFL Draft. There is risk he re-injures his foot which needs to be factored in when paying his draft price."
"Jimmy Graham GB (7)","5","141.06","5.67","5.02","","Graham saw his numbers plummet in every measurable category, except for touchdowns. Now he plays football in Green Bay with a QB that averages 31 TDs a season. Don’t plan on Jimmy’s yardage or receptions to improve from 57/520, but on the back of double-digit TDs Graham could still be a top-5 TE option."
"Evan Engram NYG (9)","6","138.91","3.50","6.12","","Evan Engram not only had a breakout rookie season, he had the single best rookie season for a tight end in the modern NFL. Yes, better than Gronk and better than Jeremy Shockey. It’s easy to see those numbers and presume that he might continue to take a step forward in 2018. However, Odell Beckham, Brandon Marshall, and Sterling Shepard all missed significant chunks of time. In 2018 they have a new coaching staff as well as an expected target-hog in Saquan Barkley. So while he might be a better all around player going into year two, there are a few obstacles in his way towards improvement."
"Trey Burton CHI (5)","7","136.87","3.67","6.06","","Trey “Boo Boo” was an absolute beast in the 5 games he started without Zach Ertz in the lineup. In fact, his average over those games would have placed Burton on pace to be the tight end #4 according to last year’s scoring. With a big contract to be the starter for the Bears in 2018 he is widely believed to be taking on the “Travis Kelce” tight end role that new head coach Matt Nagy employed in KC. If that’s the case, Burton could be the steal of the draft at tight end."
"Delanie Walker TEN (8)","8","126.95","3.00","7.09","","Walker doesn’t carry the appeal of a top-3 TE. That’s really the biggest knock against him. He has been a top-6 guy the past 3 seasons. Last year’s drop was directly related to QB Marcus Mariota’s drop in TD percentage. Walker still had 70+ receptions and over 800 yards, but his TDs dropped from 7 to 3. Mariota’s passing TD total dropped from an average of 22 per season to 13. Walker is like a cheese pizza. It’s never going to top your list, but it gets the job done."
"Kyle Rudolph MIN (10)","9","123.71","3.00","7.05","","Rudolph could not follow up his no.2 fantasy finish of 2016 with another elite year. He still finished as the TE7 and now has a QB upgrade in Kirk Cousins that has shown he will rely on the TE position. The targets are simply hard to come by when Diggs and Thielen are healthy. He is a great end zone option so he still carries value as a weekly starter."
"Jordan Reed WAS (4)","10","121.19","9.00","8.09","","It’s been over 2 years since we’ve seen the type of fantasy performances that earned Reed his Rule 86 moniker. Last year was completely lost, the lowest yards-per-reception of his career, and he will be coming into 2018 off of a toe surgery and will likely miss OTAs. He lost his QB Kirk Cousins, but luckily Cousins is replaced by Alex Smith a man that is known for feeding his TE. The draft price won’t be nearly as high as it has been for Reed, but the upside comes with massive risk."
"O.J. Howard TB (5)","11","108.40","4.00","13.09","","Howard was in our busts list last season and the promising rookie finished as a disappointing tight end 19. The problem with Howard has nothing to do with talent, the guy is a physical freak. The problem with Howard is that he’s a phenomenal blocker and lines up with another solid tight end who isn’t. Cameron Brate still appears to be the primary tight end target in the passing game, but with Howard’s talent this could be the year he takes over that role."
"David Njoku CLE (11)","12","106.31","4.33","9.06","","While it feels like the highly touted prospect had a disappointing rookie season, the truth is he was actually above average when it comes to rookie tight ends historically. This shouldn’t be surprising considering that in year two, Njoku is still only 21 years old. Njoku should take a large step forward this season as a player, but the targets might not be there for him due to the addition of Jarvis Landry and 16 games from Josh Gordon. Drafting him in redraft appears to be an unnecessary risk, but keep a close eye on him as the season starts."
"Jared Cook OAK (7)","13","106.06","3.67","0.00","","It will take some real soul searching and contemplation to draft Jared Cook this year, but there are reasons to believe. The team dumped their best red zone weapon in Michael Crabtree and replaced him with potentially washed WR Jordy Nelson and Martavis Bryant. Cook had nearly 700 yards with only 2 TDs last year, a number that screams for positive regression. Cook has always alured for fantasy of what could be, this could be the year he isn’t a complete disappointment."
"Jack Doyle IND (9)","14","105.38","4.33","10.07","","When Doyle is heavily featured in the offense he can come through for fantasy. Unfortunately he has competition at the TE position this year with the Colts bringing in Eric Ebron. Ebron isn’t an earth-shattering FA pickup by the team, but it instantly draws memories of Dwayne Allen and Coby Fleener on the same team. They both would have big games, but they weren’t reliable to start unless their counterpart missed time."
"George Kittle SF (11)","15","103.75","4.67","12.02","","Kittle is a widely disagreed upon prospect. Some say that George Kittle is the best breakout candidate of the year based on his talent and the new full time starter throwing him the ball, Jimmy Garoppolo. That could certainly be true. It could also be true however that the additions of two rookie wide receivers and a healthy Pierre Garcon could render Kittle an unusable asset. He’s worth taking a shot at, but be prepared to cut bait if he isn’t a centerpiece early in 2018."
"Tyler Eifert CIN (9)","16","101.22","8.33","13.04","","Eifert simply cannot stay healthy. He finished his contract year with 2 games played. The market was not feeling him and he returned to the Bengals on a 1 year ‘prove it’ deal. His end zone prowess should not be ignored, the man has appeared in 39 games and has 20 TD receptions to his name. No one should be blamed for avoiding Eifert all together, but he carries the upside of Jimmy Graham’s TD total for the price of a Kia."
"Benjamin Watson NO (6)","17","99.33","4.33","0.00","","Watson returns to New Orleans after a rather forgetful time in Baltimore. Watson did enough last year to finish as a TE1 on only five weeks a top-12 option. Watson gets a massive upgrade at the QB position with Drew Brees, but this is a very different team than the year the TE saw his breakout. Fortunately Watson knows the system and should make a smooth transition to the starting lineup. He will be at the back of a very long line for targets though."
"Charles Clay BUF (11)","18","99.24","4.33","0.00","","Mr. Necessary looks to yet again be...necessary. The Bills no.1 WR is currently Kelvin Benjamin. Zay Jones the no.2 will miss the entire offseason coming off a surgery. It’s a total mish-mash of WRs you really would prefer not to have to rely on. Clay had a handful of solid games last year, but that was with an established connection with QB Tyrod Taylor. It will now be AJ McCarron or Josh Allen throwing him the ball. Clay has talent and opportunity, but that remains to be known if it will be enough."
"Austin Hooper ATL (8)","19","94.49","3.00","13.09","","Hooper is a fine player for the Atlanta Falcons. But his line of 49/526/3 seems to be pretty close to his ceiling. Yes, Matt Ryan should see some positive regression in terms of TD passes, but Hooper simply isn’t featured in the red zone. Over the final 6 games of the season he didn’t see a single RZ target. The talent is there to be a featured fantasy TE, but the offensive scheme is not."
"Eric Ebron IND (9)","20","89.80","4.67","0.00","","It was a long four years those on #TeamEbron waiting for the breakout season to come. It didn’t and the team turned down his 5th-year option. In classic Ebron fashion, he gave fantasy owners just enough at the end of the year to get the imagination spinning of his potential. The Colts bought in on the potential and brought him in to share TE duties with Jack Doyle. If Andrew Luck returns to form, Ebron is going to have a handful of big games. It would take a position takeover though for him to become a reliable weekly starter."
"Luke Willson DET (6)","21","89.09","5.33","0.00","","Luke Willlllllllson is a more talented receiving tight end than you might know. Part of the reason he has not yet shown it in the NFL is that he spent the past two seasons behind star tight end, Jimmy Graham. With the Lions he is taking over for a team that lost over 100 targets to the tight end position with the departures of Eric Ebron and Darren Fells. Willson is a perfect best ball player or last round flyer with the sleeper potential to break out."
"Ricky Seals-Jones ARI (9)","22","85.20","6.00","0.00","","The Arizona Cardinals have long desired a pass catching tight end but have failed to find that tight end in the draft. Perhaps last year’s breakout stretch from undrafted rookie, Ricky Seals-Jones, will pave the way for a solution. When Seals-Jones got the chance in week 11 he had a two game stretch where he combined for 7 receptions for 126 yards and 3 touchdowns. With the injury late in the season to incumbent starter Jermaine Gresham, Seals-Jones has the potential to be a late round breakout."
"Cameron Brate TB (5)","23","85.03","3.67","0.00","","Brate saw his fantasy value vanish when Tampa Bay selected OJ Howard in the 1st round. Or did he?!?! Well, mostly he did. Brate did have a really solid opening to the season finishing as a TE1 in 5 of 7 weeks. Unfortunately, Howard started to see an uptick in useage the 2nd half of the season and Brate couldn’t be utilized. He is a trusted red zone weapon for Jameis and the Bucs did give him a very hefty contract. Brate should be treated as a streaming option."
"Austin Seferian-Jenkins JAC (9)","24","82.33","4.00","0.00","","ASJ was an uber talented prospect who tragically disappointed over his first handful of years in the league. Once considered a freak athlete, he was rarely used downfield last season, which is usually telling of a player having lost a step. However, there is reason for hope. The Jaguars released Marcedes Lewis and signed ASJ with the intent of utilizing the position more in 2018. Rave reviews from OTAs might not be something you can bank on, but it’s still good to hear the coaches are impressed."
"Vance McDonald PIT (7)","25","78.63","5.67","0.00","","There are uncountable reasons to not buy a ticket for the Vance Dance. He’s never played a full season, he’s never been over 400 yards, he has 78 receptions in his 4-year career. The Steelers believed enough to trade for him right before the season including his bloated contract. It was a season lost to learning the playbook and injuries. We were given a tiny glimpse of the potential in the playoffs when he was featured and dropped 10/112 on the Jaguars. There are already very positive reports coming from Pitt beat reporters about his planned usage. He’s a dart throw, but a dart throw with a lot of upside."
"Vernon Davis WAS (4)","26","74.18","4.00","0.00","","Vernon Davis is the perfect tight end compliment to Jordan Reed. Davis can’t hold the mantle of dominate tight end for 16 games at age 34, but he steps up huge as a Reed-replacement when the inevitable injury happens. Davis will be valuable through the year, but shouldn’t be drafted in any format as he is a weekly fill in option when the time comes."
"Ed Dickson SEA (7)","27","69.56","5.67","0.00","","A lot has been made about the possible breakout of Nick Vannett after the departure of Jimmy Graham. However, if you follow the money it is more likely that Ed Dickson and his contract worth up to $14 million are set to become the heir apparent. That being said, Ed Dickson is no Jimmy Graham and will more than likely only be a worthy fantasy play on the handful of weeks he grabs a touchdown."
"Hayden Hurst BAL (10)","28","68.75","3.50","0.00","","Hayden Hurst, a 24 year old rookie, shocked everyone when he was selected as the only first round rookie in the 2018 NFL Draft. Theoretically, the landing spot and draft capital are perfect in Baltimore. Two years ago Joe Flacco made a hobbled Dennis Pitta the league leader in targets at the position. Unfortunately, two rounds later the Ravens drafted another promising tight end. As of yet we do not have a clear picture of how each will be used, but more than likely they will cannibalize each other’s value in 2018."
"Stephen Anderson HOU (10)","29","67.74","3.67","0.00","","Anderson is a very under the radar prospect who has a chance to be a productive tight end in 2018. An undrafted tight end in 2016, Anderson is a very athletic and still young (25) tight end who received 52 targets in limited work last season. With a healthy Deshaun Watson and the retirement of C.J. Fiedorowicz, Anderson could possibly overtake Ryan Griffin to be the #1 tight end on a solid offense."
"Nick Vannett SEA (7)","30","62.06","3.67","0.00","","Vannett has received a lot of sleeper love after Jimmy Graham and his double digit touchdowns went away. While it’s “possible,” count us skeptical. The Seahawks went out and gave a contract worth up to $14 million dollars to Ed Dickson, a man they believe was simply buried by Greg Olsen in Carolina. Based on early reports out of camp Ed Dickson appears to have the faster track to fantasy production."
"Gerald Everett LAR (12)","31","58.97","3.67","0.00","","Gerald Everett was a 2nd round draft pick in a loaded tight end class in 2017. The good news for Everett is that he is on a creative and high powered offense now that Sean McVay is there. The bad news is that there are an abundance of mouths to feed and they are all more proven than him. With Cooks, Woods, Kupp, and even Gurley ahead in the passing game it is hard to see where he breaks in."
"Mike Gesicki MIA (11)","32","57.42","6.67","0.00","","Gesicki (Guh-sick-ee) is an athletic freak who destroyed the combine testing as a 97th percentile athlete. Many people’s #1 rated rookie tight end actually finds himself in a somewhat desirable situation. The Dolphins lost a lot of targets with Jarvis Landry gone as well as having the incumbent starter, Julius Thomas, leave town. It’s possible that Gesicki is involved in his rookie year although we should pump the breaks based on the history of Ryan Tannehill and rookie tight ends underperforming in year one."
"Jesse James PIT (7)","33","55.23","3.67","0.00","","Jesse James has good games every now and then. That’s about the best you can say regarding this most vanilla of tight ends. The ceiling is low, especially with early reports of Vance McDonald being featured in the passing game. He shouldn’t be drafted in any redraft or keeper leagues and is at best a weekly DFS play."
"Jake Butt DEN (10)","34","54.56","6.67","0.00","","Jake Butt was a very talented and promising rookie who was drafted by the Broncos last year knowing full well that he couldn’t play at all in 2017 due to injury. Now this offseason, the two most targeted TEs left town in A.J. Derby and Virgil Green. Jake Butt’s primary competition is Jeff Heuerman. Count us not scared of the competition. That being said, there isn’t a good history of TE utilization in Denver but hopefully Jake will butt his way into the lineup."
"Mark Andrews BAL (10)","35","44.92","7.00","0.00","","Mark Andrews was one of the main targets last year from fellow incoming rookie, Baker Mayfield. He projects to be a strictly pass catching tight end in the NFL, which is good for fantasy. Unfortunately, he was drafted behind another rookie tight end, Hayden Hurst, who went in the first round. Rookies don’t usually show much at tight end and it will be double tough to break out in year one splitting targets with Hurst."
"Jonnu Smith TEN (8)","36","43.49","3.67","0.00","","Jonnu Smith is a very promising tight end prospect, but he won’t have the opportunity to break out unless the starter, Delanie Walker, had to miss significant time. As such, Smith is a candidate only for dynasty leagues at this time and shouldn’t be drafted in redraft or keeper leagues just yet."
"Tyler Higbee LAR (12)","37","39.70","3.67","0.00","","Not only does Higbee have to contend with 3 more than competent WRs and an elite pass catching RB, he has to compete with 2nd year TE Gerald Everett. Higbee should not be on your fantasy radar."
"Tyler Kroft CIN (9)","38","38.70","3.67","0.00","","Kroft is an above average replacement for the oft-injured Tyler Eifert. With Eifert out last season Kroft stepped in and had a solid 7 touchdowns. Even still, he only finished as the tight end #15 despite being the 16 game starter. With Eifert (theoretically) back, Kroft will only be a waiver pickup after Eifert goes down."
"Adam Shaheen CHI (5)","39","35.84","5.00","0.00","","It was all looking good for the giant second year tight end when the Bears let John Fox go to allow their team to open up their offense and get the most out of Mitch Trubisky. Then they signed Trey Burton to a big money contract and all hope that Shaheen would take over the move-tight-end role all but vanished. He’s worth keeping an eye on, but not worth drafting in all redraft/keeper formats."
"Dallas Goedert PHI (9)","40","33.94","5.00","0.00","","Goedert was one of the most promising pass catching tight ends in this year’s rookie class. In fact, he was the #1 rookie tight end for all three of the Ballers prior to the draft. While his college film and production were fantastic, his landing spot leaves quite a lot to be desired. Goedert will be behind Zach Ertz, filling the shoes left by Trey Burton. If Ertz goes down, Goedert could make some noise, but he should not be drafted in normal redraft leagues."
"Jermaine Gresham ARI (9)","41","29.53","6.50","0.00","","Arizona does not have the deepest core of pass catching options, so it’s entirely possible that the tight end position could become valuable if the quarterback play is above average. Unfortunately for Gresham, he tore his achilles in Week 17 last season and now has to battle against promising second year player, Ricky Seals-Jones. Gresham would still be the starter for now, but you’ll need to monitor his health as we get closer to the season."
"Rico Gathers DAL (8)","42","23.07","6.50","0.00","","Rico has gathered so much hype from such little performance. Last year, in preseason, he put up two monster games and got the dynasty community salivating based on what they saw. Then he missed the entire season with concussion problems and has still yet to play a single snap in a meaningful NFL game. Everyone wants to know who Jason Witten’s replacement is going to be and the truth is, there probably won’t be one."
