"wr","Rank","Points","Risk","ADP","Vid","RP","Notes"
"Antonio Brown PIT (7)","1","278.22","1.00","1.05","","","Antonio Brown is one of the best wide receivers of all-time. In 2017, no player in the NFL reached 116 receptions OR 1569 receiving yards. Antonio Brown has AVERAGED those same numbers: 116 receptions, 1569 receiving yards, and 10 TDs over the past FIVE seasons. He’s in a tier of his own as an NFL WR right now, and the most consistent player in fantasy football."
"DeAndre Hopkins HOU (10)","2","246.33","1.30","1.09","","","Many fantasy owners felt burned when DeAndre Hopkins followed up his monster breakout 2015 campaign with a 1st Round price tag and a WR29 finish in 2016. Well those that believed in him, or grabbed him at a huge value in 2017 drafts were handsomely rewarded. Hopkins went from his disappointing 2016 line of 78 catches, 954 receiving yards and 4 TDs up to 96 catches (+18), 1,378 receiving yards (+424), and a league-leading 13 TDs (+11). It’s a huge plus if QB Deshaun Watson is healthy."
"Odell Beckham Jr NYG (9)","3","240.04","2.30","1.12","","","Plain and simple: when he’s on the field, he’s unstoppable. Odell’s 2017 season was cut short during Week 4 from an ankle injury. Prior to that though- 6th in fantasy points during his rookie season with only 13 games played, 5th in 2015, and 4th in his third season. He’s had at least 90 receptions, 1,300 yards and 10 TDs in each of those first three seasons."
"Julio Jones ATL (8)","4","227.72","3.00","2.02","","","Oh ho hum… it was just another 1400+ yard season for Julio Jones in 2017. That’s FOUR straight seasons of 1400+ receiving yards including 1871 in 2015. Julio is a physical freak and will deliver week-winning performances for your fantasy squad. This next part is from last year’s Julio write-up and is even more true now- “leaves fantasy owners wanting more in the TD department.” That was before he dropped down to 3 TDs in 2017. His peak of 10 receiving TDs came back in 2012. Whether it’s Matt Ryan, the new coaching regime, or something else… the Falcons must find a way to utilize Julio near the endzone."
"Michael Thomas NO (6)","5","214.50","2.00","2.04","","","Jarvis Landry held the record for most receptions in his first two NFL seasons with 194. Michael Thomas broke that record in 2016-2017 with 196 catches. It certainly helps having a Hall-of-Fame QB throwing the ball, and while Drew Brees turned 39 earlier this year, he did not show a decline in ability. It was rather a shift in the offense to a wildly successful run game with Ingram & Kamara leading the way, that led to a drop in passing TD numbers. Still, Thomas’ receptions and receiving yards went up. Michael Thomas may not deliver monster weeks, but seems like a lock to finish as a Top 10 WR again."
"Keenan Allen LAC (8)","6","212.38","4.30","2.05","","","Keenan put the “injury prone” tag to rest in 2017, playing all 16 games while finishing as the WR3 in fantasy points. He enters his 6th season at a prime WR age of 26. Double-digit TDs are likely out of reach, but Keenan showed last season that he can top 100 receptions and come close to 1,400 receiving yards if he’s healthy. He’s got a real rapport with Philip Rivers and defenders commonly struggle to cover him as shown by his Reception Perception results."
"Davante Adams GB (7)","7","207.40","3.00","2.06","","","A general rule in the fantasy community is to not bank on touchdowns. They can come and go due to a number of factors each season. However, when Aaron Rodgers is the quarterback, that’s an exception. Davante Adams finished as the WR8 in 2016, and the WR14 in 2017, even with Rodgers missing a majority of the 2017 season. Still, he was under 1000 receiving yards in both, and topped out at 75 receptions. So clearly, he needed the 12 TDs in 2016 and 10 in 2017 to put him among the top fantasy wide receivers. Adams is just 25 years old. There’s reason to believe his receptions and yards can rise this season with the loss of veteran WR Jordy Nelson. The Packers did sign TE Jimmy Graham who had 10 TDs in 2017."
"A.J. Green CIN (9)","8","205.81","2.70","2.09","","","The overall struggle of the Bengals offense really hampered A.J. Green’s production in 2017. With more than one key loss on the offensive line, QB Andy Dalton was constantly under pressure. The Bengals had the 8th lowest number of Pass plays in the league, as well as the 4th lowest number of Run plays. Yikes. However, if the offense can get back on track, Green returns to Top 5 WR potential. His average in seasons with 15 or more games played: 84.2 receptions, 1241.6 yards, 9.4 TDs."
"Adam Thielen MIN (10)","9","199.63","3.00","3.09","","","Holy breakout Batman! Thielen ended 2016 on a high note with 12 catches for 202 yards, and 2 TDs in Week 16. He never let up and became a big time fantasy football weapon in 2017. On 143 targets, he compiled 91 catches for 1,276 yards and 4 TDs. That was good for the WR10 in Half PPR. Now, Kirk Cousins comes to MInnesota and the Vikings offense could be one of the best. The only potential hiccup is a change at offensive coordinator, with Pat Shurmur headed to the Giants. Thielen finds a way to get open and can put up similar numbers with similar targets."
"Doug Baldwin SEA (7)","10","195.74","4.30","3.06","","","Baldwin didn’t quite break 1000 yards (991) in 2017, but still managed 8 TDs on 75 receptions. The Seahawks brought in Brandon Marshall and Jaron Brown but lost redzone beast TE Jimmy Graham. It should be more of the same for Baldwin with one of the best all around QBs in the game, Russell Wilson in his prime. Expect around 115 targets, close to 80 catches, 1000 yards, and 7 TDs. He’s a very solid WR2 for most fantasy squads. | UPDATE: Doug Baldwin is expected to miss most of the preseason with knee soreness. Team is hopeful he will be ready for Week 1 of the regular season."
"Larry Fitzgerald ARI (9)","11","195.03","3.70","3.12","","","Until Larry Legend stops being a reception machine, we have to expect it. He’s topped 100 receptions each of the three seasons. The Cardinals spent a 2nd round pick this season on rookie WR, Christian Kirk. However, we all know even highly drafted WRs can take a long time to adapt in the NFL, if they ever do at all. With competent QB play between either Sam Bradford or rookie, Josh Rosen, Larry Fitzgerald should continue to be a target and reception monster. Boost in PPR leagues."
"Amari Cooper OAK (7)","12","193.03","5.30","3.11","","","Expectations have been high for Amari Cooper since the Raiders picked him 4th overall in the 2015 NFL Draft. Many expected the breakout last year (3rd season), but instead he finished 2nd in votes from the #FootClan for the “Poopiest Pants” of the Year Award. After topping 1000 yards in each of his first two seasons, he was south of 50 catches and 700 yards in 14 games played in 2017. The Raiders offense struggled as a whole, and new head coach, Jon Gruden, apparently wants to run, run, run. Cooper is very talented and just 24 years old. We’re still waiting to see if he can be a true #1 WR in the NFL and improve on contested catches."
"Stefon Diggs MIN (10)","13","187.84","4.70","3.02","","","Reception Perception results show us that when Diggs is at his best, he gets separation from defenders as well as anyone in the league. The problem for Diggs has been injuries, missing 8 games over his first 3 seasons. Playing with those same injuries certainly hurt his fantasy production as well. Still, he’s shown the ability to make big time plays and help win weeks for fantasy owners. IF he can stay healthy for 15 or 16 games, he is in contention for a Top 12 WR finish."
"T.Y. Hilton IND (9)","14","187.48","5.70","3.03","","","We're actually seeing Andrew Luck play this preseason, and that makes all the difference for T.Y. Hilton. Hilton is a talented receiver but last year was a prime example of how many talented receivers aren’t at all immune to a major loss at QB. Backup QB Jacoby Brissett is a decent backup QB in the NFL, but he’s not who you want throwing the ball to your fantasy wideouts. With Andrew Luck in 2016, Hilton led the league in receiving yards (1,448). If you believe Hilton can be great again, you'll have to pay for it in the 3rd Round."
"Mike Evans TB (5)","15","187.34","3.70","3.01","","","After a huge breakout season in 2016 with over 1300 receiving yards and 12 TDs, some fantasy owners put Evans in the Bust category for 2017. He was drafted in the 1st Round of fantasy drafts, and finished as the WR17. Evans never delivered any big week-winning performances, which he did so often in 2016. He’s still a young, supreme talent that should bounce back in 2018. Drafting him mid-late 2nd Round is much more appealing than his 1st Round price tag from last year’s drafts."
"Tyreek Hill KC (12)","16","182.42","4.70","3.03","","","Tyreek the Freak burst onto the scene in the 2nd half of 2016. He followed that up with a big 2017 season, finishing as the WR8 in Half PPR scoring. He’s not much of a weapon in the red zone, but is the most dangerous threat in the game to take any play to the house from any part of the field. His reception totals are most likely capped, especially with the Chiefs paying big for WR Sammy Watkins. Maybe Tyreek can stay just as efficient with his elite skills, but there’s a chance for regression as well."
"Marvin Jones DET (6)","17","178.96","4.00","6.02","","","Marvin Jones had shown big play, and big game ability in year’s past, but never put it together for an entire season. That changed in 2017. He averaged 18 yards a catch, which was the league-high among WRs with at least 50 catches. And while he only had 61 catches, his 9 TDs made up for it, along with 1,101 receiving yards. If he’s healthy, he’s a key downfield weapon for Matthew Stafford and should have no problem finishing as a WR2. Just be warned that a big part of his production was the 9 TDs, and you can’t always bank on those to repeat."
"Jarvis Landry CLE (11)","18","177.81","4.00","4.02","","","Target monster. Reception monster. Landry has had 84 receptions in all four seasons of his NFL career, topping 100 in two of them. However, he now joins the Browns, who are full of change in 2018. They have two new quarterbacks in Tyrod Taylor and Baker Mayfield. New offensive coordinator, Todd Haley, had major success in Pittsburgh. Then there’s fellow WR Josh Gordon, who proved he can put up Elite fantasy numbers with enough targets. While he’s a very talented receiver, it’s hard to see Landry getting the same amount of targets he’s been used to."
"Golden Tate DET (6)","19","176.04","2.30","4.12","","","Tate’s numbers in 2017 were just as expected based on the few years before. He hit 4 years straight of 90+ receptions, and topped 1000 yards in 3 of 4 of them. Even with that yearly consistency, his weekly performances are more boom/bust than most realize. Even with those receptions, his upside is capped from yardage and averaging close to 5 TDs a year. He is certainly most valuable in PPR leagues."
"Demaryius Thomas DEN (10)","20","174.98","3.30","4.10","","","Thomas fits right into the “boring old veteran” category that makes his ADP drop year after year. Combine that with new QB Case Keenum coming to town, Thomas could become a value pick in fantasy drafts. He’s had at least 140 targets over the last SIX seasons. While his days of being a Top 10 wideout are likely over, he can still be a reliable source of receptions for your fantasy squad. Bonus: he hasn’t missed a game over the past six seasons."
"Allen Robinson CHI (5)","21","173.79","4.70","5.05","","","Maybe no longer the “Target Monster” as we once called him, but Allen Robinson is still a young receiver with a ton of talent. The Bears inked Robinson to a 3-year, $42 million deal this offseason. He broke out in 2015 with 80 catches for 1400 yards and 14 TDs, but followed that up in 2016 finishing as the WR25 in Half PPR scoring. Robinson then suffered a torn ACL in the first game of 2017. Now he gets a new chance with his new team, and 2nd year QB, Mitch Trubisky. Former head coach, John Fox, is gone, and we’ve yet to see what the Bears new offense will look like."
"JuJu Smith-Schuster PIT (7)","22","168.75","4.30","4.04","","","It was a big-time rookie season for JuJu finishing as the WR22 with just 14 games played. He easily replaced Martavis Bryant as the number two receiver behind Antonio Brown. He finished with 917 and 7 TDs, and should be able to at least repeat that in 2018."
"Chris Hogan NE (11)","23","166.72","4.30","4.08","","","Without Edelman in the lineup in 2017, Hogan was having a huge first half with Brady. Through the first 8 weeks, he was the WR7 in Half PPR scoring! Then a shoulder injury kept him out for most of the remainder of the regular season. Now at age 32, Edelman returns and Brandin Cooks is gone. If he can stay healthy, we’ve seen the upside for Hogan with Brady as recently as last year. | UPDATE: Julian Edelman is suspended for the first 4 games. Hogan could be a big contributor early on, as we saw last season."
"Brandin Cooks LAR (12)","24","166.48","4.70","5.05","","","Brandin Cooks has has over 1,000 receiving yards in each of the past three seasons. He’s still just 24 years old. The problem among the fantasy community is not knowing when his “boom” games are coming. As soon as you lock him into your lineup, a dud game hits. He now transitions to the Rams, his third NFL team in his first five seasons. While QB Jared Goff is an ascending talent, Cooks spent his first four seasons playing with either Drew Brees or Tom Brady. Not bad! Cooks is an elite speedster, but we’ve yet to see how he’ll fit into this offense. He’s a true “Fantasy Wildcard” for 2018."
"Alshon Jeffery PHI (9)","25","164.92","5.70","7.02","","","On a one-year “prove-it” deal, Alshon did just that in 2017 with the Eagles. He came up big in Super Bowl 52 with 73 yards and a TD. His season was highlighted by 9 TDs but other stats were underwhelming. The good thing is that he had 120 targets, tied for 13th among wideouts. The bad is that he was well south of 1000 yards and had just 57 receptions, tied for 35th. With another 120 targets, he could certain see increased reception and yardage totals. He had surgery this offseason for a torn rotator cuff and has the chance to start the season on the PUP. This would be six games missed. Monitor the situation and draft with caution."
"Josh Gordon CLE (11)","26","163.57","6.00","4.08","","","It’s been years but we do know Josh Gordon’s upside is THE WR1. However, it’s a different Browns team with target hog Jarvis Landry in town. The Browns also have two new QBs in Tyrod Taylor and rookie Baker Mayfield. Throw in a new offensive coordinator in Todd Haley, the Browns offense is basically a fantasy wildcard."
"Corey Davis TEN (8)","27","160.38","5.00","5.11","","","Could this be a breakout campaign for Corey Davis? He was picked #5 overall by the Titans in 2017. Injuries hampered Davis in his rookie season, as well as a low scoring offense, as he finished with just 34 catches for 375 yards and 0 TDs in 11 games. Many believe Davis is the real deal and can grow to be one of elite receivers in the game. It will take a massive jump in targets and obviously production for that to happen. The Titans have a new head coach and offensive coordinator. Hopefully for Davis’ sake, they move away from the “exotic smash-mouth” mentality."
"Robby Anderson NYJ (11)","28","157.14","7.00","8.04","","","Anderson has shown big play potential in his first 2 seasons. That’s with terrible quarterback play in New York as well. With 63 catches for 941 yards and 7 TDs, Robby A. was the WR16 in Half PPR scoring. If Anderson can get past his legal issues and doesn't miss any time, he could be a big value in 2018."
"Sammy Watkins KC (12)","29","157.06","5.30","7.12","","","Sammy Watkins has to be one of the biggest wildcard picks in fantasy football drafts. What will the Chiefs offense look like with Patrick Mahomes instead of Alex Smith? The Chiefs paid Watkins well and he’s still just 25 years old. Expectations have been high since he was the 4th overall pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, but he has been hampered by injuries. Fellow WR Tyreek “the Freak” Hill has established himself as a game-breaking threat, but Watkins could be the more valuable receiver in the redzone, having scored 8 TDs with the Rams last season. It remains to be seen how Watkins fits in this offense but there’s certainly upside."
"Marquise Goodwin SF (11)","30","154.59","3.70","5.01","","","Marquise “Greatwin” is a speedster and had a solid stretch near the end of last season. This was without veteran WR Pierre Garcon in the lineup though. He can remain a threat in Kyle Shanahan’s offense, but it may be in a boom/bust fashion. While Garcon is back, all reports out of training camp indicate that Goodwin has had a strong connection with Jimmy Garoppolo throughout training camp. If you believe in the hype, you'll most likely have to grab Goodwin in the 7th Round."
"Randall Cobb GB (7)","31","153.77","5.30","7.11","","","Jordy Nelson is gone, along with his 88 targets from 2017. Davante Adams has cemented his role as the WR1 in the offense. The #2 and even #3 receiving options for Aaron Rodgers are still very fantasy relevant. After a big 2014 season, with 1200+ yards and 12 TDs, it’s been hard for fantasy owners to count on Cobb since then. Without Nelson there and Adams getting attracting the most attention from the defense, Cobb could be a big fantasy value."
"Cooper Kupp LAR (12)","32","153.56","3.30","8.01","","","After being drafted in the 3rd Round of last year’s NFL Draft, Kupp was surprisingly productive in 2017 (as was the entire Rams offense). On 94 targets he had 62 catches for 869 yards and 5 TDs. His red zone target numbers were through the roof. Kupp finished just outside the WR2 range in 2017, and that’s right around what we expect for 2018."
"Emmanuel Sanders DEN (10)","33","151.60","4.30","6.06","","","Often overlooked, Emmanuel Sanders has been a consistent fantasy producer, finishing as a Top 20 WR in 2015 and 2016. He had 130+ targets and 1000+ receiving yards in each of 2014-2016. Last season was injury plagued and Trevor Siemian plagued. While his Top 15 potential may be gone, he certainly has the skills and potential to win weeks for owners. Case Keenum should be the solid QB that Denver has been looking for since Peyton Manning retired. The Broncos did spend a 2nd Round pick on WR Courtland Sutton and a 4th Round pick on WR DaeSean Hamilton."
"Michael Crabtree BAL (10)","34","150.27","5.20","6.07","","","Crabby Patty revived his career when he signed with the Raiders back in 2015. Now he moves onto Baltimore; a less than ideal spot for wide receiver fantasy production. Since QB Joe Flacco entered the league in 2008, the highest WR finish was Derrick Mason as the WR17 in 2009. Over the nine seasons where Flacco played 16 games, the average highest WR finish for the Ravens is the WR24. So if you’re drafting Crabtree as your WR3, then he should be a solid value. He’s had no less than 8 TDs in each of the past three seasons. Crabtree will be 31 just after the start of the season."
"Pierre Garcon SF (11)","35","147.60","4.70","9.09","","","Garçon’s career had a resurgence when the 49ers signed him to 5-year $47,500,000 contract. Offensive guru, Kyle Shanahan, has now brought in QB Jimmy Garoppolo, and Garcon should be the #1 target. He gets a big boost in PPR leagues, but can’t be expected to score anymore than 5 TDs. He missed the 2nd half of 2017 due to a neck injury. The good news is that he avoided surgery and should be good to go for 2018."
"Sterling Shepard NYG (9)","36","144.07","3.00","9.12","","","In 2016, Shepard had a solid rookie season with 65 catches for 683 yards and 8 TDs. The Giants were terrible last season and he dealt with injuries. Still, in his healthy weeks without Odell in the lineup, he made the most of big target share games. Targets could be hard to come by with Odell Beckham & Evan Engram in the offense. Add in that the Giants drafted RB Saquon Barkley 2nd overall; they could have a competent run game for the first time in awhile. One more plus for Shepard is that the new offensive coordinator, Pat Shurmur, comes from the Vikings. He of course aided the fantasy success of Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen."
"Kelvin Benjamin BUF (11)","37","144.02","5.00","9.08","","","With 9 TDs and 1000 receiving yards in 2014, Benjamin appeared to be on his way to a successful NFL career. However, injuries have hampered his fantasy production and caused him to miss all of 2015. He was traded to the Bills part way through last season. His hope is that the Bills hit big on their 1st Round pick from the 2018 NFL Draft, QB Josh Allen."
"Robert Woods LAR (12)","38","142.02","3.70","9.06","","","Woods had a solid, few game stretch in 2017 with the breakout of the LA Rams. He was plagued by injuries though, missing 4 games. Sammy Watkins is no longer with the team. Now, Cooper Kupp remains, and Brandin Cooks comes to town. Cooks has over 1000 receiving yards each of the past 3 seasons. Fantasy owners may be left disappointed with Woods where he’s being drafted."
"Nelson Agholor PHI (9)","39","141.78","4.00","9.04","","","Lead for dead in the fantasy world after two seasons, Agholor proved that he belongs in the NFL. He was a 1st Round draft pick by the Eagles, who were coached by Chip Kelly at the time. Last year as Carson Wentz and the Eagles broke out, Agholor was a part of that. On 95 targets, he finished as the fantasy WR23 with 62 receptions for 768 yards and 8 TDs. The touchdown number most likely comes down, but yards could come up. Alshon Jeffery COULD start the season on the PUP, missing six weeks. This in theory would mean a big boost in targets for Agholor. However, there's also a chance that Carson Wentz isn't ready to go Week 1."
"Keelan Cole JAC (9)","40","141.63","3.70","13.01","","","Cole is an exciting sleeper pick. As an undrafted rookie last season, Cole burst onto the scene halfway through the year and legitimately helped lead fantasy owners to championships last season. It's a crowded WR core in Jacksonville, but if he wins the job he has already shown the ability to produce at a high level in the NFL. | UPDATE: Marqise Lee left Week 3 of preseason with a knee injury. If the injury is significant, Cole could see an uptick in targets."
"Allen Hurns DAL (8)","41","140.73","5.00","11.03","","","The opportunity is there for Hurns as the WR corps in Dallas is thin. He signed a 2-year, $12 million deal with Dallas this offseason. With Dez Bryant and Jason Witten gone, that’s 219 targets up for grabs. Cole Beasley and Terrance Williams are still around, and they drafted Michael Gallup in Round 3 this year."
"Devin Funchess CAR (4)","42","136.51","4.30","8.11","","","2017 Footie Award winner for Nickname of the Year! “Devin S. Scrumptious” now has competition for targets at the WR position. The Panthers selected D.J. Moore in 1st Round of the NFL Draft. Much of Funchess’ production in 2017 was with veteran TE Greg Olsen injured (and out). We don’t like Funchess where he’s being drafted on average."
"Kenny Stills MIA (11)","43","135.84","4.70","10.06","","","161 targets (Jarvis Landry) left the Dolphins this season. They did bring in free agents, Danny Amendola and Albert Wilson, but Stills could be the biggest benefactor. He’s shown the ability to find the endzone on low target numbers. Over the past two seasons he has 15 TDs, which is tied for 7th among WRs. His highest fantasy season finish (Half PPR) was the WR27 on 105 targets last season."
"Will Fuller HOU (10)","44","135.70","5.30","6.11","","","He started the season late due to injury, but when Fuller and Deshaun Watson were both healthy, they were putting up insane numbers. Unsustainable numbers. Last year, in a span of four games, Fuller scored 7 TDs! He exited early in Week 17 with a left knee injury. If he is healthy, and Watson is healthy, he’s certainly worth a boom flex play."
"Jamison Crowder WAS (4)","45","134.56","3.70","7.07","","","Crowder was a solid PPR fantasy producer for a stretch in 2016. The Redskins offense lacked weapons in 2017 and Crowder was the main target for a few weeks. It’s uncertain how the new Redskins offense will shake out in 2018. There are a few main moving pieces, the biggest being new QB Alex Smith. Terrelle Pryor is gone, but Josh Doctson is entering his 3rd season, and the Redskins signed Paul Richardson to a 5-year, $40 million contract. Jordan Reed could remain the top target when he’s on the field."
"Donte Moncrief JAC (9)","46","133.14","5.30","0.00","","","Part of Donte Moncrief’s upside the past four years has been QB Andrew Luck. He showed potential but has missed many games due to injury. This offseason Moncrief signed a 1-year, $9.6 million deal with Blake Bortles and the Jaguars. It’s a murky receiving corps with Marqise Lee, Dede Westbrook, Keelan Cole, and 2nd round rookie pick, D.J. Chark. In 2017, the Jaguars winning formula included having the 11th least amount of passing attempts. | UPDATE: Marqise Lee left week 3 preseason with what could be a knee injury. If he were to miss significant time, it could mean more targets for Moncrief."
"D.J. Moore CAR (4)","47","125.89","5.70","10.09","","","Moore is one of, if not the, most athletic wide receiver in this year’s rookie draft class. The NFL took notice of his athleticism and production in college as he was the first wide receiver drafted in 2018. He goes to a team in Carolina that appears to be missing a true WR1, which means he has a clear enough path to targets even in his rookie season. While Cam Newton might not be the most prolific passer, he has supported several fantasy WR1s in the past."
"Kenny Golladay DET (6)","48","125.21","5.70","12.05","","","Kenny G, oh so smooth… at times… but he dealt with injuries in his 2017 rookie season. Some highlight reel grabs make Kenny G look like he could be special. However, targets may be hard to come by as Marvin Jones broke out and Golden Tate remained solid in 2017. First Golladay needs to stay healthy before being considered a reliable fantasy factor."
"DeSean Jackson TB (5)","49","124.03","5.30","0.00","","","The story of DeSean Jackson is that he can blow up for a big game at any point, but is hard to trust as a consistent fantasy producer. The Buccaneers offense struggled as a whole in 2017. They need to be better for Jackson to be fantasy relevant. He’s only played a full season twice in his 10-year career and has only surpassed 62 receptions in one season. In those 9 seasons, he’s been a WR1 twice and a WR2 twice, finishing outside the Top 24 among wideouts the other 6 seasons. | UPDATE: The word out of training camp is that 2nd year wideout Chris Godwin could be lining up as the WR2 across from Mike Evans."
"Jordy Nelson OAK (7)","50","123.77","7.30","8.08","","","Long time Packers WR, Jordy Nelson, heads to the Raiders. QB Aaron Rodgers to Derek Carr is a colossal drop off. Other things working against Jordy are his age (33), and that new head coach, Jon Gruden, wants to run the ball. If you want something to believe in, he was THE WR1 just two seasons ago in 2016. However, he was younger and was with Aaron Rodgers."
"Julian Edelman NE (11)","51","122.71","5.30","6.03","","","Now age 32 and coming off a torn ACL, Edelman may come at a big discount in your fantasy draft. Especially in PPR formats, Edelman will be a value pick as long as he’s healthy. If he can play close to 16 games (with Brady at QB), he should hit at least 90 receptions and 1000 yards. | UPDATE: Edelman has been suspended for four games"
"Dede Westbrook JAC (9)","52","120.30","4.70","13.11","","","Westbrook looked good at times in his rookie season. One problem is that it’s a crowded WR corps as the Jaguars signed Donte Moncrief in the offseason, and drafted D.J. Chark in the 2nd Round. Marqise Lee and Keelan Cole sure looked good at times last year too. Lastly, the Jaguars are clearly a run-first offense. | UPDATE: Marqise Lee left Week 3 of Preseason with what could be a significant knee injury. If he were to miss significant time, that could be an uptick in targets for Westbrook."
"Tyrell Williams LAC (8)","53","119.99","4.00","0.00","","","Williams was a sneaky good player in 2016 finishing as the WR15! That’s what 119 targets from Philip Rivers can do for you. However, once Keenan Allen returned (and stayed healthy) in 2017, Williams’ targets dropped to 69. This was also without Mike Williams in the lineup for a number of games. The Chargers used the 7th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft on him. Even with TE Hunter Henry out for the season, we project Williams outside of the WR4 range."
"Chris Godwin TB (5)","54","119.29","4.30","13.03","","","Godwin was a big Matt Harmon favorite coming out of college. Once he was drafted to the Buccaneers, it was clear that it would be awhile before he saw very much opportunity. Elite WR Mike Evans is there and they brought in veteran DeSean Jackson last offseason. However, reports out of training camp indicate that Godwin could be the WR2 across from Mike Evans, over DJax."
"Tyler Lockett SEA (7)","55","119.25","5.30","12.09","","","Many have been waiting for the breakout, especially after Lockett was deemed a Matt Harmon favorite. The problem is that he’s on the Seattle Seahawks. Their winning formula has consisted of running the ball a lot and playing stellar defense. Even last year when the Seahawks couldn’t run the ball well, and Russell Wilson threw for 34 TDs… Lockett finished with 45 catches for 555 yards and 2 TDs. This offense has only supported one wideout for fantasy (Doug Baldwin). Jimmy Graham and Paul Richardson are no longer on the team (175 targets in 2017) but they’ve signed veteran WR Brandon Marshall and Jaron Brown. Maybe he’ll never breakout, or maybe he needs a new team. (Think Golden Tate from the recent past.)"
"John Brown BAL (10)","56","117.27","7.30","11.08","","","Brown has shown so much potential, but has been plagued by injuries. In his 2nd season, he topped 1000 yards and had 7 TDs, but the last two seasons have been disappointing. He now joins a crowded Ravens receiving corps which includes Michael Crabtree and Willie Snead. If he can stay healthy, Crabtree should still be the #1 target in the offense. Joe Flacco has not shown be great for fantasy receiver success."
"Danny Amendola MIA (11)","57","116.41","6.50","13.10","","","Amendola leaves a proven elite offense to what could be one the worst offenses in the league in The Dolphins. Jarvis Landry was a big fantasy contributor with a ton of targets, but he’s a big step above Amendola who is 32 years old. He’s also no stranger to injuries. As disappointing as DeVante Parker has been, he’s still there along with Kenny Stills."
"Mike Williams LAC (8)","58","116.41","6.00","9.08","","","Williams was picked 7th overall in the 2017 NFL Draft. Injuries never let him get going in his rookie season, while Keenan Allen came back with a vengence to show that he IS the guy in that offense. Now with TE Hunter Henry out for the season, Williams could be a weapon near the red zone. Tyrell Williams has been fantasy relevant at times in this offense, so Mike Williams should certainly be able to as well if healthy."
"Ryan Grant IND (9)","59","115.37","4.00","0.00","","","The word out of training camp is that Ryan Grant will be the WR2 for this offense behind only T.Y. Hilton. If QB Andrew Luck stays healthy, Grant could be a solid late round value in drafts, or helpful waiver pickup."
"Paul Richardson WAS (4)","60","114.38","5.00","0.00","","","Former 2nd Round NFL Draft Pick, Paul Richardson signed a big deal with the Redskins this offseason. The Redskins, traded for veteran QB Alex Smith, who had an outlier season in 2017. He finished as the QB4, while the previous 5 seasons averaged to about the QB17. It’s hard to expect much from Richardson until we see what this offense looks like. Other competition for targets include wideouts- Jamison Crowder and Josh Doctson."
"Josh Doctson WAS (4)","61","114.20","5.30","14.02","","","Doctson was the 22nd overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. After missing most of his rookie season, he finished with 35 rec, 502 yards, and 6 TDs on 78 targets in 2017. This offseason, the Redskins lost QB Kirk Cousins in free agency and traded for Alex Smith. At WR they no longer have Terrelle Pryor, but signed Paul Richardson signed to a nice deal. Jamison Crowder sneakily remains as well. Finally, IF Jordan Reed is healthy, he’s still probably see a number of targets from Smith. It may be difficult for Doctson to see a big enough target share to have a big fantasy impact."
"Calvin Ridley ATL (8)","62","113.15","4.00","10.09","","","Ridley was the perfect draft pick for the Atlanta Falcons and Matt Ryan. He should make them an overall better offense immediately. Unfortunately for Ridley, it’s not the best landing spot for his fantasy production as he has zero chance to be the WR1 for this team. He’ll have his weeks due to his great route running and ability to murder a zone defense, but behind Julio and Sanu it will be difficult for him to be a breakout rookie."
"Mohamed Sanu ATL (8)","63","111.84","4.00","0.00","","","Sanu was surprisingly the WR30 in Half PPR scoring last year. That’s as good as it gets through with Julio Jones commanding so many targets. The Falcons also used their 1st Round pick this year on WR Calvin Ridley."
"Ted Ginn Jr NO (6)","64","111.14","3.70","0.00","","","The excitement for Ted Ginn signing with New Orleans last year was obviously because of QB Drew Brees. While Brees skillswise may have been the same, his stat line was not. The Saints offense was able to run and their defense was actually good for the first time in a long time. Ginn has had around 750 yards the past three seasons. However, the memory of the 9 TD season with Cam Newton in 2015 is still there for some. If Brees’ TD total balances out some, Ginn could have more than the 4 he had last season. The Saints also signed WR Cameron Meredith this offseason. We aren’t expecting Ginn to be very fantasy relevant."
"Devante Parker MIA (11)","65","110.77","6.80","13.01","","","Will the breakout ever happen? The opportunity should be there this year with target hog, Jarvis Landry, off to Cleveland. Parker was drafted to be a true WR1 in the NFL, but hasn’t shown any sort of consistent production. A handful of highlight reel catches show his raw talent. Another thing in his defense is the less than ideal QB play over his first three seasons (Ryan Tannehill/Matt Moore/Jay Cutler). Maybe, just maybe with Jarvis Landry gone, Parker can shine with increased targets. Kenny Stills… still looms though. | UPDATE: Parker has suffered a broken finger in training camp. He's hoping to be ready for Week 1."
"Taywan Taylor TEN (8)","66","109.83","5.30","14.02","","","The Titans not only took Corey Davis #4 overall in 2017, but also Taywan Taylor in Round 3 of that draft. He didn’t play many snaps in 2017, and therefore didn’t have much of an impact. We’ll see what 2018 holds with a new head coach and offensive coordinator in town."
"Jermaine Kearse NYJ (11)","67","105.68","5.00","0.00","","","If Robby Anderson is in the lineup, it seems that he’s taken over the WR1 role for the Jets. Kearse will compete for the WR2 role with Terrelle Pryor and Quincy Enunwa."
"Cole Beasley DAL (8)","68","104.68","3.30","0.00","","","Beware if you catch the Beasles this season. He’s a good NFL slot receiver but we don’t expect him to be much of a fantasy contributor. With Dez Bryant and Jason Witten gone, that’s 219 targets up for grabs. However, we expect new Cowboys WRs, Allen Hurns and Michael Gallup, to make an impact."
"Quincy Enunwa NYJ (11)","69","104.65","3.70","0.00","","","Enunwa showed flashes in 2016, leading the Jets (bad) offense with 857 receiving yards. He then missed all of 2017 with a neck injury, that required surgery, so needs to be monitored as the season nears. WRs Robby Anderson and Jermaine Kearse are still there, and they signed Terrelle Pryor this offseason."
"Rishard Matthews TEN (8)","70","103.48","6.70","0.00","","","Matthews could continue to be a value in fantasy drafts. 2nd year WR Corey Davis figures to take a big step forward, but if not, Matthews could be the biggest benefactor. In 2016, when Mariota and the Titans offense was much better, Matthews was close to 1000 yards and had 9 TDs. | UPDATE: Matthews is starting Training Camp on the PUP and his situation needs to be monitored."
"Geronimo Allison GB (7)","71","102.72","5.70","12.08","","","Without Jordy Nelson in Green Bay, that leaves DaVante Adams and Randall Cobb as the veteran receivers. While the Packers spent three picks (all 4th Round or later) on WRs in the 2018 NFL Draft. Still, Geronimo Allison has the chance to be the WR3 for Aaron Rodgers. That means he could certainly have a fantasy impact. He’s barely being drafted but could be a big waiver wire pickup at some point."
"John Ross CIN (9)","72","101.81","6.00","14.05","","","Ross did Nothing his rookie season, after being selected #9 overall in the 2017 NFL Draft. With elite WR A.J. Green still leading the way for the Bengals, his target share can only go so high. However, veteran WR Brandon LaFell has been released. If John Ross is healthy, he should have enough playing time to show what he can do and if he was worth such a high selection in last year's NFL Draft."
"Terrelle Pryor NYJ (11)","73","98.37","5.00","0.00","","","You might need to plug your nose… Terrelle Pryor is the reigning “Footie Award” Winner for Poopiest Pants of the Year. Pryor seemed to have pulled off the rare QB to WR transition, with some very big weeks for the Browns in 2016. After signing a 1-year “prove it” deal with the Redskins in 2017, hype and expectations grew to be through the roof. Pryor was a non-factor and he’s now on a 1-year, $4.5 million deal with the Jets. The Jets have had QB issues for the better part of the past decade. We’ll see if the 3rd overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold, is the answer."
"Albert Wilson MIA (11)","74","98.11","5.70","0.00","","","Signed by the Dolphins in the offseason, there are Albert Wilson “truthers” out there, happy to see him leave the Chiefs. His season highs came in 2017 with 62 targets for 42 catches 554 yards and 3 TDs. Many targets left the Dolphins when Jarvis Landry signed with the Browns. Still, the Dolphins receiving corps has DeVante Parker, Kenny Stills, and Danny Amendola. | UPDATE: DeVante Parker is dealing with a broken finger and may not be ready for Week 1."
"Terrance Williams DAL (8)","75","98.08","5.00","0.00","","","Williams hasn’t ever been able to step up when Dez missed time. Even with Dez and Witten gone, Williams can’t be expected to be a reliable fantasy piece. They bring in Allen Hurns and drafted Michael Gallup in the 3rd Round. Now, Williams could miss time due to legal trouble."
"Anthony Miller CHI (5)","76","95.80","5.30","12.03","","","Miller is a favorite of many people who study collegiate wide receivers. He is a great route runner and is now going to a team focused on offense with a new coach and new offensive coordinator. That’s great news for a rookie being able to get involved. That being said, Miller will start out as the 3rd wide receiver at best on the depth chart behind their free agent acquisitions, Allen Robinson and Taylor Gabriel. He’s probably an unneeded draft pick in redraft and keeper formats."
"Martavis Bryant OAK (7)","77","94.87","6.30","14.08","","","For awhile, it was just off-the-field issues stopping Bryant from being a fantasy force. Last year it was rookie WR Juju Smith-Schuster. Bryant has been traded away from one of the most elite offenses in football to the Raiders. He’ll be the #2 or #3 option at wideout behind Amari Cooper. It’s hard to know what this offense will look like, and how much fantasy production it can provide. New head coach, Jon Gruden, has spoken of his desire to return to an old school offense with lots of running."
"Michael Gallup DAL (8)","78","94.09","5.70","11.10","","","Gallup has as good a path to WR1 status as any rookie wide receiver in this year’s draft. The Cowboys cut Dez Bryant, lost Bryce Butler, traded Ryan Switzer and replaced them with Allen Hurns, Michael Gallup, and (RB) Tavon Austin. That’s a much easier depth chart to rise to the top of. Gallup as a prospect is also very talented getting the seal of approval from Matt Harmon in part due to his 80% contested catch rate."
"Mike Wallace PHI (9)","79","93.68","5.00","0.00","","","He was the WR23 in 2016, topping 1000 receiving yards. However, he was the WR40 last season and hasn’t topped 4 TDs in the last 3 seasons. Now he joins the Eagles as the WR3, who have star Alshon Jeffery, and young wideout, Nelson Agholor. Turning 32 in August, he’s not expected to be much of a fantasy contributor in most leagues with Jeffery and Agholor in the lineup. | UPDATE: Reports say that Alshon Jeffery COULD begin the season on the PUP, missing six games. This could make Mike Wallace fantasy relevant once again."
"Dante Pettis SF (11)","80","92.84","5.30","0.00","","","Pettis is an example of where NFL teams like a player more than the consensus rankings prior to the draft. The 49ers traded up in the 2018 draft to nab their guy ahead of big names like James Washington and Christian Kirk. This should tell us something about the 49ers having a plan to use him. He might be more special teams focused in his rookie season, but the opportunity to step up with Jimmy G and Kyle Shanahan is not far away."
"Chad Williams ARI (9)","81","91.91","6.00","0.00","","","Larry Fitzgerald keeps doing his thing, and the Cardinals drafted WR Christian Kirk in the 2nd Round of this year’s NFL Draft. Chad Williams barely played for the Cardinals during his rookie 2017 season. It will take a big swing for him to become a fantasy factor in 2018."
"Cameron Meredith NO (6)","82","91.26","6.30","11.05","","","Meredith put up a receiving line of 66/888/4 in 2016 with the Bears in 14 games. While it’s not a massive stat line, he showed potential for a 2nd year WR, on a boring offense. He suffered a nasty preseason injury causing him to miss all of 2017. As he continues to recover, he’s not a lock to be ready for Week 1. The intriguing part is that he signed with the Saints. Meredith could be a sneaky value if healthy, playing on an elite offense."
"Brandon Marshall SEA (7)","83","89.70","7.70","0.00","","","Brandon Marshall had a terrible age 34 season with the Giants that ended in injury. Somewhat surprisingly he found a new home in Seattle which is a pretty decent landing spot. With Paul Richardson and Jimmy Graham gone, there is room for him to fit in. His best chance at fantasy success would come from soaking up red zone targets, but we put his probability of succeeding pretty low."
"Courtland Sutton DEN (10)","84","87.73","5.70","14.08","","","Sutton is a big bodied project who many had as their #1 wide receiver prospect heading into the draft. Ironically, he projects as Demaryius Thomas, the player who will ensure that Sutton has no value in 2018. Sutton will probably sit most of his rookie year but is a great pick in dynasty formats due to the contract situation of DT and Emmanuel Sanders."
"Chester Rogers IND (9)","85","85.17","4.00","0.00","","","Chester Rogers is in the mix with Ryan Grant for the WR2 role on the Colts. Early word out of training camp gives the edge to Grant. Still, if Andrew Luck stays healthy, both players could be fantasy relevant at times in 2018."
"James Washington PIT (7)","86","84.61","5.70","0.00","","","Washington is a beloved collegiate wide receiver (other than to Jason, who doesn’t think he’ll translate). There’s good news and bad news in his landing spot. First, Washington is sometimes thought of exclusively as a deep threat option which could be a bad thing if he had not gone to the Steelers where he can slide into the deep threat role vacated by Martavis Bryant. The bad news is that there is no doubt he is firmly locked behind Antonio Brown and Juju Smith-Schuster. It’s worth noting for dynasty owners that the Steelers also drafted Washington’s college QB, Mason Rudolph, as Big Ben’s eventual replacement."
"Christian Kirk ARI (9)","87","83.17","6.30","14.07","","","Kirk appears to be one of the most NFL ready wide receivers due to how well he worked out of the slot. Strangely, he goes to a team where there is zero chance to dethrone the current slot-king, Larry Fitzgerald. It could give Kirk a great opportunity to try the outside wide receiver role; or it could be great training environment for 2019. He’s a risky late round pick in redraft, but it could still pay off this season."
"Zay Jones BUF (11)","88","75.83","6.00","0.00","","","Zay Jones had a disgustingly bad rookie season. He followed that up with a viral video in the offseason of him going crazy due to some unnatural substances in his bloodstream. Then, he just recently had knee surgery and this comes after also having shoulder surgery. It has not been a good year for Jones. Unfortunately, the horizon doesn’t appear to be any brighter with A.J. McCarron and raw rookie, Josh Allen at QB. Zay Jones would need to take a major 2nd year leap to find fantasy success in 2018."
"Taylor Gabriel CHI (5)","89","73.59","4.00","0.00","","","Gabriel is part of the revamped Chicago Bears team. They added star WR, Allen Robinson, and used a 2nd Round NFL Draft pick on Anthony Miller. In his first 4 seasons, he never topped 36 receptions or 621 receiving yards. In the magical Falcons 2016 season, he found the end zone 6 times. If the Bears can find a way to use Gabriel, it could still be tough to predict when the big plays/games are coming."
"Corey Coleman BUF (11)","90","69.94","6.30","0.00","","","There is good news and bad news with Corey Coleman being traded to the Bills. On the positive side, he is no longer buried behind Landry, Gordon, and Duke Johnson on a Bills team that wasn’t expected to throw enough for Coleman to matter. Corey Coleman immediately becomes the 2nd best receiver for the Bills. That’s the bad news, the Bills do not project to be a high scoring team nor do they have a QB capable of making Coleman relevant. Overall, it’s a bump up for Coleman but probably not one that matters."
"Adam Humphries TB (5)","91","68.79","3.30","0.00","","","Pronounced with an ‘Umphries, Adam has long been a surprisingly valuable safety valve in the middle of the field for Jameis Winston. Unfortunately for him, the offense as a whole seems to have outgrown most of his services. With DeSean Jackson and more importantly, Chris Godwin, set to see more receptions in 2018, Humphries will be mostly an afterthought."
"Willie Snead BAL (10)","92","67.33","6.30","0.00","","","The Saints did Not have the “Need for Snead” in 2017 and beyond. He’s now a part of the Ravens receiving corps along with Michael Crabtree and John Brown. Joe Flacco has not been friendly to his wideouts in terms of fantasy production. Snead showed potential but that was with future Hall of Fame QB, Drew Brees. He may have weeks of fantasy relevance, but it may be hard to see them coming."
"J.J. Nelson ARI (9)","93","66.45","4.00","0.00","","","J.J. has been the benefactor over the last few years of injuries ahead of him, shallow depth charts, and a Bruce Arians system that valued the deep ball and speed more than anyone. Now, he has a new system, new coach, and new wide receivers to content for that starting job. It’s not out of the question that Nelson retains the starting outside role, but it’s equally no sure thing."
"Travis Benjamin LAC (8)","94","66.21","3.70","0.00","","","With Keenan Allen in the lineup, Benjamin had 34 catches for 567 yards, and 4 TDs last year. It’s hard to expect anything more than that."
"Kendall Wright MIN (10)","95","64.13","5.30","0.00","","","Wright could have the WR3/slot role for the Vikings in 2018. Clearly Thielen, Diggs, and Rudolph will command the majority of targets. Wright isn’t expected to be fantasy relevant in most leagues."
"Tyler Boyd CIN (9)","96","64.05","4.30","0.00","","","Hasn’t been much of a factor in the Bengals offense his first two seasons. The Bengals released veteran WR Brandon LaFell so this give Boyd a chance to show something. WR John Ross was drafted by the Bengals in the 1st Round last year so he'll compete with him for targets, with A.J. Green clearing getting his share no matter what."
"Jaron Brown SEA (7)","97","62.84","5.00","0.00","","","Brown leaves the Cardinals and signs with the Seahawks. It’s a longshot for him to be fantasy relevant behind Doug Baldwin and amongst Tyler Lockett and Brandon Marshall."
"Jeremy Kerley BUF (11)","98","62.06","6.00","0.00","","","Kerley is two seasons and one PED suspension away from his 115 target campaign. In general, Kerley is an uninspiring and entirely mediocre wide receiver, but he could benefit if the recent shoulder and knee surgeries keep Zay Jones down. Kerley could become the default WR2 for the Bills, but let’s be honest, people aren’t even clamoring to draft the WR1 in Buffalo."
"Tre'Quan Smith NO (6)","99","60.83","6.30","0.00","","","Smith landed in a great situation with Hall of Famer Drew Brees and a mediocre receiving core behind Michael Thomas and a hopefully-healthy Cameron Meredith. He has great speed for a player of his size (6’2” and 210lbs). He could eventually be the replacement for Ted Ginn Jr., but hopefully that comes before Drew Brees is gone. For now, he’s more of a dynasty draft pick and a wait and see prospect."
"Brice Butler ARI (9)","100","59.25","4.30","0.00","","","Butler signed with the Cardinals this offseason, leaving the Cowboys, where he made a few big plays. Larry Fitzgerald remains as the target hog, while the Cards used their 2nd Round pick this year on WR Christian Kirk. Downfield threat, J.J. Nelson remains, while Jaron Brown and John Brown are gone. Brice Butler is a fine late round sleeper pick as he is currently the WR2 on the Cardinals."
"Torrey Smith CAR (4)","101","50.33","4.70","0.00","","","Another new team for Torrey Smith. He hasn’t been fantasy relevant since 2014."
"Amara Darboh SEA (7)","102","46.41","4.30","0.00","","","Darboh was picked in the 3rd Round of the 2017 NFL Draft. Year after year we’ve seen that there’s only one consistent fantasy WR for Seattle, and that’s Doug Baldwin. TE JImmy Graham (10 TDs in 2017) and Paul Richardson are no longer in town, but with Baldwin, Lockett, and Marshall there, it’s a long shot that Darboh can become fantasy relevant in 2018."
"Laquon Treadwell MIN (10)","103","42.50","7.50","0.00","","","Was drafted in the 1st Round by the Vikings in 2016. He’s done basically nothing through two seasons. Meanwhile, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs have broken out. Maybe he needs the traditional three years in the NFL to get acclimated. However, it’s hard to imagine Treadwell being fantasy relevant in 2018… and maybe ever."
"Jakeem Grant MIA (11)","104","34.80","6.50","0.00","","","Jakeem “Mighty Mouse” Grant was pretty much uninvolved in the Dolphins plans until the final four games of last year. In those four games he put up a stat line of 10/188/2 to show a little bit of promise. With Jarvis Landry out of the way, Grant is perhaps worth a very late dynasty pick but nothing more until he establishes a role in season."
"D.J. Chark JAC (9)","105","31.21","4.30","0.00","","","Chark is fast. Like, one of the fastest in the world, fast. He wasn’t utilized enough at LSU due to them being such a run heavy team, but the NFL can usually find a place for those players who are on another level of athletic. That being said, he is a rather raw talent who has plenty to work on and is now buried on a deep depth chart in Jacksonville. He is only a DFS or dynasty candidate right now."
"Curtis Samuel CAR (4)","106","28.67","4.30","0.00","","","The Panthers selected Samuel in the 2nd Round in 2017. He’s a WR/RB gadget player, who dealt with injury his rookie season and didn’t have an impact."
"Breshad Perriman BAL (10)","107","26.80","8.30","0.00","","","Perriman was a first round draft pick who once showed promise. At this stage in his career his biggest hope is to just make the roster after the Ravens signed three new WRs. Perriman is someone you shouldn’t trust or draft until after he’s broken out. So probably never."
"Kevin White CHI (5)","108","26.35","7.50","0.00","","","After being selected as the 7th overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, Kevin White has been nothing but a bust. He missed the entire 2015 season due to injury, as played in 5 total games in 2016 & 2017. He’s also low on the Bears depth chart after bringing in free agents Allen Robinson and Taylor Gabriel, plus selecting Anthony Miller with pick 19 in the 2nd Round of the 2018 NFL Draft."
"Tavon Austin DAL (8)","109","18.07","4.30","0.00","","","The Cowboys traded for Austin this offseason. Their WR corps is thin, but Austin has only been disappointing since the Rams drafted him 8th overall in 2013. He was barely used by the Rams in 2017. His highest fantasy finish ever was the WR26 in 2015."
"Josh Reynolds LAR (12)","110","17.05","2.50","0.00","","","Fellow rookie WR on the Rams, Cooper Kupp, was the one who had a mini-breakout. He led the Rams in receiving yards with 869. Kupp was one of the red zone target leaders in the NFL. Still, Reynolds is much more of an outside receiver, and the Rams just brought in Brandin Cooks. Robert Woods is still there as well. We aren’t expecting much from Reynolds in 2018."
"Dez Bryant FA (-)","111","","5.00","0.00","","","Has Dez lost a step? Or two? Or three? Will he prove that the problem was Dak Prescott and not himself? Reception Perception results show that Bryant struggled to create separation in 2017. Yet, he’s out to prove that he still be a top wideout."
"Malcolm Mitchell NE (11)","111","","5.00","0.00","","","Mitchell showed flashes of talent and most importantly, a connection with Tom Brady in this 2016 rookie season. However, he missed all of 2017 with a knee injury, and is still working back from it. The Patriots traded away Brandin Cooks and let Danny Amendola walk, so that leaves Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan, Jordan Matthews; plus deeper guys like Cordarrelle Patterson, Phillip Dorsett and Kenny Britt. If healthy, Mitchell should be the WR3 or WR4 in this offense. There’s upside for anyone involved in the Pats offense, but as of now expectations are low. | UPDATE: Julian Edelman has been suspended for 4 games. Still, Mitchell's health is the first step to getting more playing time."
